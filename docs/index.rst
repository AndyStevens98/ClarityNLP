ClarityNLP
==========

ClarityNLP is a clinical NLP platform developed for the purpose of analyzing and aggregating clinical text to extract complex, computed phenotypes. ClarityNLP combines NLP techniques and libraries with a powerful query language, NLPQL, to identify patients and their clinical observations, extracted from text. ClarityNLP gives you insights into clinical (and other) text without a lot of custom configuration, and NLPQL lets you write your own definitions to find the patients and features that are relevant to your project.
