#Dashboard
=============

The Dashboard Client is designed to give you an overall view of your ClarityNLP instance at a glance.
It contains lists of:

* Documents you have uploaded
* Queries you have created and saved via the [Query Builder](/query_builder)
* Jobs that have been run on the instance
