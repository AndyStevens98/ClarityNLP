Query Builder
=============

The Query Builder is a tool to assist in the development of NLPQL.

When you first get to the page, it will prompt you with a name and version for your NLPQL.

NOTE: Your NLPQL MUST have a unique version if the name of the query has already been saved.

After you have named and versioned your query, you can begin building your query.

To add a component to the query, simply click on the component you would like to add, fill out the fields that you need, and click the corresponding add button.

After you finish building your query, you can click the save button just above the dropdowns to save your query indefinitely. You can also run the query by clicking the run button to the top right. 

This is where you can add a limit to your query if you want to.

If running the query was successful, you will be prompted with a JSON with some metadata about your query.

NOTE: If at any point you want to scrap your query you can click the clear button at the bottom of the text area to start over.

Loading a Query
-------------

If you navigated here from a link or the `Dashboard`_, your query will automatically load into the text area.

You can edit this query by clicking the edit button below the text area. This will make the text area free form and you can edit it however you see fit. 

NOTE: We only recommend doing this if you have experience building NLPQL from scratch, to learn more about this check out the `NLPQL Reference`_.
