    "### 2. Select a few concepts that we would like to explore and use for phenotype development\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we explore how we can leverage unstructured clinical notes and ClarityNLP to explore a clinically relevant set membership problem for the purpose of feature engineering and/or patient inclusion/exclusion from a cohort of interest. This can be thought of as a step away from rule-based/heuristic patient identification, and toward computational phenotype development. The techniques reviewed here can be particularly useful in situations where the set/term in question cannot be easily derived from structured data alone, and/or when the set/term in question is difficult to quantify or is unlikely to explicitly appear in structured data. Examples include but are by no means limited to: {`poor social support`; `homelessness`; `substance abuse`; `socioeconomic status`; `financial distress`; `domestic abuse`; `insomnia`; `poor medication compliance`; etc.}.\n",
    "\n",
    "These topics represent important **socioeconomic** and **behavioral determinants of health** and may also effect eligibility for participation in clinical trials, but are difficult for clinical researchers to detect without manual chart review and/or other types of resource-intensive interventions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the sections that follow, we'll walk through ways in which NLP techniques can help address this problem. It is important to note that these steps represent an **iterative, human-in-the-loop process**, rather than a one-step solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can begin by aggregating our existing clinical and contextual knowledge of the topic/concept, and using this knowledge to develop a baseline NLPQL query. It is not necessarily important at this stage that our list of terms and/or constraints be exhaustive, as our initial goal is to explore the possible universe of patients. we can return to this step in an iterative fashion, and impose more specific criteria as we go. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of today's discussion, we'll consider three different set membership problems: (1) homelessness; (2) insomnia/trouble sleeping; (3) poor medication compliance. For each of these three set membership questions, we're hoping to understand whether a given patient might currently be experiencing the condition, or has experienced the condition in the past (to the extent that their historical data is present in the system).\n"
