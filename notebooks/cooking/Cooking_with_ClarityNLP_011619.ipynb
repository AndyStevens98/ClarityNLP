    "### 1.1 The FDA Adverse Drug Event Evaluation Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team is currently working on a submission to the [FDA Adverse Drug Event Evaluation Challenge](https://sites.mitre.org/adeeval/). This challenge requires participating teams to ingest a set of drug labels (in XML format), parse these labels to detect and classify adverse events, and output a set of labels indicating the location, class, and associated [MedDRA](https://www.meddra.org/) information for each positive occurrence of an adverse event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we'll break down some of the components of our drug label evaluation strategy to show how you can use components of the ClarityNLP pipeline (specifically, a custom task, and our chart review GUI-based tool) to detect and classify (a subset of) adverse event mentions when they appear in drug labels and/or patient notes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 The Challenge Training Dataset\n",
    "The FDA challenge training dataset contains text from 100 drug labels, stored in XML format. Each drug label is mapped to a series of ground-truth labels; for the sake of clarity, we will continue to distinguish between **drug** labels and **ground-truth** labels. Each ground-truth label corresponds to an adverse event associated with the drug in question (though there are several possible ways that this relationship may manifest itself), and contains the following fields:\n",

    "### 1.3 Adverse Event Categories\n",
    "There are several reasons that the FDA may consider an adverse event to be (or not be) of interest to the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology (OSE). The unique set of reasons, along with their definitions and counts within the FDA training dataset, appear in the table that is generated below:"

    "Looking at the table above, it's clear that the majority of labeled adverse events fall into a few categories: specifically: (1) adverse events that are mentioned in the instructions in a hypothetical context; (2) general terms, which are too broad to be useful; (3) indications (e.g., clinical symptom(s) for which using the drug in question would be appropriate; and (4) complications, which might occur as the result of an AE, but are not adverse events per se.\n",

    "\\* Not: in the FDA training dataset, **Pregnancy** is a medDRA term which appears in the **meddra_llt** field, and co-occurs with multiple grouth-truth reasons. The reason that is of interest here is **contraindication** (e.g., drugs that are contraindicated for women who are pregnant, nursing, or may become pregnant in the near term). For example:\n",

    "### 2.1 Generation of Sentence-Level Labels\n",
    "In order to build a rules-based model for detecting/classifying sentences with respect to ground-truth labels, we must first make the provided XML labels into a sentence-level feature matrix that can be used to assess model performance on sentences that do and do not contain each of our ground-truth labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step in this direction was to parse the original XML drug label documents, find the adverse events within the text (using the section-level offsets provided as part of the ground-truth labels), and replace each adverse event with the concatenation of the \"type\"||\"reason\" fields. This will allow us to identify patterns at a more generic level (since we'll be working with the finite set of {\"type\"||\"reasons\"} rather than the more specific set of underlying adverse events, which are linked to medDRA terms within the ground-truth labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "The functions that appear below represent the next step in the process, and serve to generate a sentence-level feature matrix, such that each sentence in each drug label document represents a row, and each possible \"type\"||\"reason\" ground-truth label represents a Boolean-valued column. \n"

    "Our next objective is to review the sentences that are positive instances of the subset of the ground-truth labels that we are interested in, using a combination of tools, including manual review, n-gram frequency analysis, dependency parsing, topic modeling, and embeddings. Our hope is that these tools can help us to discover latent pattern(s) that we can use to develop a sentence-level Boolean classifier that will offer improved performance and efficiency relative to the status quo. We've divided up this part so that each ground-truth label gets its own subsection, as some of the rules we'll develop are label-specific. \n",
