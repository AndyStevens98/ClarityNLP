    "For details on installing and using ClarityNLP, please see our [documentation](https://claritynlp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).  We welcome questions during this presentation, as well as via Slack, Twitter (use the hashtag [#cookingWithClarityNLP](https://twitter.com/hashtag/cookingWithClarityNLP?src=hash&lang=en)), or on [GitHub](https://github.com/ClarityNLP/ClarityNLP/issues). **We also encourage suggestions for topics to cover in future cooking sessions!**\n",

    "Our team is currently working on a submission to the [FDA Adverse Drug Event Evaluation Challenge](https://sites.mitre.org/adeeval/). This challenge requires participating teams to ingest a set of drug labels (in XML format), parse these labels to detect and classify adverse events, and output a set of labels indicating the location, class, and associated [MedDRA](https://www.meddra.org/) information for each positive occurrence of an adverse event.\n",

    "Today, we'll break down some of the components of our drug label evaluation strategy to show how you can use components of the ClarityNLP pipeline (specifically, a custom task, and our chart review GUI-based tool) to detect and classify (a subset of) adverse event mentions when they appear in drug labels and/or patient notes. \n",
