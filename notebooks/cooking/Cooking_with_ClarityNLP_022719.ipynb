Each clinical trial is assigned a unique **NCT ID** such as NCT03601923, which is the ID for a now-recruiting trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug Niraparib for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.\n",

As of this writing, the current download is 871 MB in size. The download file is updated at near-daily intervals. If you want to run natural language processing or machine learning algorithms on the clinical trial data, the AACT database is what you need. The AACT website contains links to download and installation instructions, the data dictionary and database schema, and lots of other documentation."
