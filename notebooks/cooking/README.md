## Cooking with ClarityNLP

Cooking with ClarityNLP is meant to focus on hands-on walkthroughs of building NLPQL phenotypes, incorporating new algorithms, and validating cohorts using the ClarityNLP platform.   Each week we take 1-2 examples and walk through them as a group. 

[View our Wiki page](https://github.com/ClarityNLP/ClarityNLP/wiki/Cooking-with-ClarityNLP) to see previous and upcoming sessions of Cooking with ClarityNLP.
