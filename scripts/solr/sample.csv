      To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Suprax and other antibacterial drugs, Suprax should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria. Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. LUPIN LIMITED LUPIN LIMITED SUPRAX CEFIXIME CEFIXIME CEFIXIME ANHYDROUS SILICON DIOXIDE SODIUM BENZOATE STRAWBERRY SUCROSE XANTHAN GUM off-white to pale yellow RECENT MAJOR CHANGES Warnings and Precautions, Phenylketonurics (5.6)                         12/2016 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Suprax (cefixime) is a cephalosporin antibacterial drug indicated for   Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections (1.1)   Otitis Media (1.2)   Pharyngitis and Tonsillitis (1.3)   Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis (1.4)   Uncomplicated Gonorrhea (cervical/urethral) (1.5) To reduce the development of drug resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Suprax (cefixime) and other antibacterial drugs, Suprax should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antimicrobial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Suprax (cefixime) is a cephalosporin antibacterial drug indicated in the treatment of adults and pediatric patients six months of age or older with the following infections when caused by susceptible isolates of the designated bacteria: 1.1 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections caused by Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. 1.2 Otitis Media Otitis Media caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. (Efficacy for Streptococcus pyogenes in this organ system was studied in fewer than 10 infections.) Note: For patients with otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, overall response was approximately 10% lower for cefixime than for the comparator [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14)]. 1.3 Pharyngitis and Tonsillitis Pharyngitis and Tonsillitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. (Note: Penicillin is the usual drug of choice in the treatment of Streptococcus pyogenes infections. Suprax is generally effective in the eradication of Streptococcus pyogenes from the nasopharynx; however, data establishing the efficacy of Suprax in the subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever is not available.) 1.4 Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. 1.5 Uncomplicated Gonorrhea (cervical/urethral) Uncomplicated Gonorrhea (cervical/urethral) caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae (penicillinase-and non-penicillinase-producing isolates). 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION   Adults: 400 mg daily (2.1)   Children: 8 mg/kg/day (2.2) 2.1 Adults The recommended dose of cefixime is 400 mg daily. This may be given as a 400 mg tablet or capsule daily or the 400 mg tablet may be split and given as one half tablet every 12 hours. For the treatment of uncomplicated cervical/urethral gonococcal infections, a single oral dose of 400 mg is recommended. The capsule and tablet may be administered without regard to food. In the treatment of infections due to Streptococcus pyogenes, a therapeutic dosage of cefixime should be administered for at least 10 days. 2.2 Pediatric Patients (6 months or older) The recommended dose is 8 mg/kg/day of the suspension. This may be administered as a single daily dose or may be given in two divided doses, as 4 mg/kg every 12 hours. Note: A suggested dose has been determined for each pediatric weight range. Refer to Table 1. Ensure all orders that specify a dose in milliliters include a concentration, because Suprax for oral suspension is available in three different concentrations (100 mg/5 mL, 200 mg/5 mL, and 500 mg/5 mL).

 Children weighing more than 45 kg or older than 12 years should be treated with the recommended adult dose. Suprax (cefixime) Chewable Tablets must be chewed or crushed before swallowing. Otitis media should be treated with the chewable tablets or suspension. Clinical trials of otitis media were conducted with the chewable tablets or suspension, and the chewable tablets or suspension results in higher peak blood levels than the tablet when administered at the same dose. Therefore, the tablet or capsule should not be substituted for the chewable tablets or suspension in the treatment of otitis media [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. In the treatment of infections due to Streptococcus pyogenes, a therapeutic dosage of cefixime should be administered for at least 10 days. 2.3 Renal Impairment Suprax may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be employed in patients with creatinine clearances of 60 mL/min or greater. Refer to Table 2 for dose adjustments for adults with renal impairment. Neither hemodialysis nor peritoneal dialysis removes significant amounts of drug from the body.

These are white to off-white, film-coated, capsule shaped tablets with beveled edges and a divided score line on each side. The tablet is debossed with ""SUPRAX"" across one side and ""LUPIN"" across the other side.   Capsules provide 400 mg of cefixime as trihydrate. These are size ""00EL"" capsules with pink opaque cap and pink opaque body with ""LU"" on the cap and ""U43"" on the body in black ink. Capsules contain white to yellowish white granular powder.   Chewable tablets provide either 100 mg or 150 mg or 200 mg of cefixime as trihydrate. The 100 mg tablet is pink, round tablet, debossed with ""SUPRAX 100"" on one side and ""LUPIN"" on other side. The 150 mg tablet is pink, round tablet, debossed with ""SUPRAX 150"" on one side and ""LUPIN"" on other side. The 200 mg tablet is pink, round tablet, debossed with ""SUPRAX 200"" on one side and ""LUPIN"" on other side.   Powder for oral suspension, when reconstituted, provides either 100 mg/5 mL or 200 mg/5 mL or 500 mg/5 mL of cefixime as trihydrate. For 100 mg/5 mL and 200 mg/5 mL, the powder has an off white to pale yellow color and is strawberry flavored. For 500 mg/5 mL, the powder has an off white to cream color and is strawberry flavored. 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS   Contraindicated in patients with known allergy to cefixime or other cephalosporins. (4) Suprax (cefixime) is contraindicated in patients with known allergy to cefixime or other cephalosporins. 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions including shock and fatalities have been reported with cefixime. Discontinue use if a reaction occurs. (5.1) Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea: Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (5.2) Phenylketonurics (5.6) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions (including shock and fatalities) have been reported with the use of cefixime. Before therapy with Suprax is instituted, careful inquiry should be made to determine whether the patient has had previous hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins, penicillins, or other drugs. If this product is to be given to penicillin-sensitive patients, caution should be exercised because cross hypersensitivity among beta-lactam antibiotics has been clearly documented and may occur in up to 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy. If an allergic reaction to Suprax occurs, discontinue the drug. 5.2 Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Suprax, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Dose Adjustment in Renal Impairment The dose of Suprax should be adjusted in patients with renal impairment as well as those undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and hemodialysis (HD). Patients on dialysis should be monitored carefully [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2)]. 5.4 Coagulation Effects Cephalosporins, including Suprax, may be associated with a fall in prothrombin activity. Those at risk include patients with renal or hepatic impairment, or poor nutritional state, as well as patients receiving a protracted course of antimicrobial therapy, and patients previously stabilized on anticoagulant therapy. Prothrombin time should be monitored in patients at risk and exogenous vitamin K administered as indicated. 5.5 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Suprax (cefixime) in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 
                        5.6 Phenylketonurics
                     Suprax (cefixime) Chewable Tablets contain aspartame, a source of phenylalanine. 100 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg strength contains 3.3 mg, 5 mg and 6.7 mg of phenylalanine, respectively. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions are gastrointestinal such as diarrhea (16%), nausea (7%), loose stools (6%), abdominal pain (3%), dyspepsia (3%), and vomiting. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lupin Pharma at 1-800-399-2561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most commonly seen adverse reactions in U.S. trials of the tablet formulation were gastrointestinal events, which were reported in 30% of adult patients on either the twice daily or the once daily regimen. Five percent (5%) of patients in the U.S. clinical trials discontinued therapy because of drug-related adverse reactions. Individual adverse reactions included diarrhea 16%, loose or frequent stools 6%, abdominal pain 3%, nausea 7%, dyspepsia 3%, and flatulence 4%. The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including diarrhea and loose stools, in pediatric patients receiving the suspension was comparable to the incidence seen in adult patients receiving tablets. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported following the use of cefixime. Incidence rates were less than 1 in 50 (less than 2%). Gastrointestinal Several cases of documented pseudomembranous colitis were identified in clinical trials. The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after therapy. Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions (including shock and fatalities), skin rashes, urticaria, drug fever, pruritus, angioedema, and facial edema. Erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and serum sickness-like reactions have been reported. Hepatic Transient elevations in SGPT, SGOT, alkaline phosphatase, hepatitis, jaundice. Renal Transient elevations in BUN or creatinine, acute renal failure. Central Nervous System Headaches, dizziness, seizures. Hemic and Lymphatic System Transient thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, prolongation in prothrombin time, elevated LDH, pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and eosinophilia. Abnormal Laboratory Tests Hyperbilirubinemia. Other Adverse Reactions Genital pruritus, vaginitis, candidiasis, toxic epidermal necrolysis. Adverse Reactions Reported for Cephalosporin-class Drugs Allergic reactions, superinfection, renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, and colitis. Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2) and OVERDOSAGE (10)]. If seizures associated with drug therapy occur, the drug should be discontinued. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated. 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS   Elevated carbamazepine levels have been reported in postmarketing experience when cefixime is administered concomitantly. (7.1)   Increased prothrombin time, with or without clinical bleeding, has been reported when cefixime is administered concomitantly with warfarin and anticoagulants. (7.2) 7.1 Carbamazepine Elevated carbamazepine levels have been reported in postmarketing experience when cefixime is administered concomitantly. Drug monitoring may be of assistance in detecting alterations in carbamazepine plasma concentrations. 7.2 Warfarin and Anticoagulants Increased prothrombin time, with or without clinical bleeding, has been reported when cefixime is administered concomitantly. 7.3 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions A false-positive reaction for ketones in the urine may occur with tests using nitroprusside but not with those using nitroferricyanide. The administration of cefixime may result in a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine using Clinitest®**, Benedict's solution, or Fehling's solution. It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix®** or TesTape®**) be used. A false-positive direct Coombs test has been reported during treatment with other cephalosporins; therefore, it should be recognized that a positive Coombs test may be due to the drug. **Clinitest® and Clinistix® are registered trademarks of Ames Division, Miles Laboratories, Inc. Tes-Tape® is a registered trademark of Eli Lilly and Company. 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS   Pregnancy: Cefixime should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. (8.1)   Nursing Mothers: Consideration should be given to discontinuing nursing temporarily during treatment with cefixime. (8.3)   Children: Efficacy and safety in infants aged less than six months have not been established. (8.4)   Geriatric Use: Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. (8.5)   Renal Impairment: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Dose adjustment is required in patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 60 mL/min. (8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 40 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to cefixime. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Cefixime has not been studied for use during labor and delivery. Treatment should only be given if clearly needed. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether cefixime is excreted in human milk. Consideration should be given to discontinuing nursing temporarily during treatment with this drug. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of cefixime in children aged less than six months old have not been established. The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including diarrhea and loose stools, in the pediatric patients receiving the suspension, was comparable to the incidence seen in adult patients receiving tablets. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. A pharmacokinetic study in the elderly detected differences in pharmacokinetic parameters [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. These differences were small and do not indicate a need for dosage adjustment of the drug in the elderly. 8.6 Renal Impairment The dose of cefixime should be adjusted in patients with renal impairment as well as those undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and hemodialysis (HD). Patients on dialysis should be monitored carefully [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3)]. 10 OVERDOSAGE Gastric lavage may be indicated; otherwise, no specific antidote exists. Cefixime is not removed in significant quantities from the circulation by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Adverse reactions in small numbers of healthy adult volunteers receiving single doses up to 2 g of cefixime did not differ from the profile seen in patients treated at the recommended doses. 11 DESCRIPTION Cefixime is a semisynthetic, cephalosporin antibacterial for oral administration.

Cefixime USP 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Cefixime is a semisynthetic cephalosporin antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Suprax chewable tablets are bioequivalent to oral suspension. Suprax tablets and suspension, given orally, are about 40% to 50% absorbed whether administered with or without food; however, time to maximal absorption is increased approximately 0.8 hours when administered with food. A single 200 mg tablet of cefixime produces an average peak serum concentration of approximately 2 mcg/mL (range 1 to 4 mcg/mL); a single 400 mg tablet produces an average peak concentration of approximately 3.7 mcg/mL (range 1.3 to 7.7 mcg/mL). The oral suspension produces average peak concentrations approximately 25% to 50% higher than the tablets, when tested in normal adult volunteers. Two hundred and 400 mg doses of oral suspension produce average peak concentrations of 3 mcg/mL (range 1 to 4.5 mcg/mL) and 4.6 mcg/mL (range 1.9 to 7.7 mcg/mL), respectively, when tested in normal adult volunteers. The area under the time versus concentration curve (AUC) is greater by approximately 10% to 25% with the oral suspension than with the tablet after doses of 100 to 400 mg, when tested in normal adult volunteers. This increased absorption should be taken into consideration if the oral suspension is to be substituted for the tablet. Because of the lack of bioequivalence, tablets should not be substituted for oral suspension in the treatment of otitis media [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2)]. Cross-over studies of tablet versus suspension have not been performed in children. The 400 mg capsule is bioequivalent to the 400 mg tablet under fasting conditions. However, food reduces the absorption following administration of the capsule by approximately 15% based on AUC and 25% based on Cmax. Peak serum concentrations occur between 2 and 6 hours following oral administration of a single 200 mg tablet, a single 400 mg tablet or 400 mg of cefixime suspension. Peak serum concentrations occur between 2 and 5 hours following a single administration of 200 mg of suspension. Peak serum concentrations occur between 3 and 8 hours following oral administration of a single 400 mg capsule. Distribution Serum protein binding is concentration independent with a bound fraction of approximately 65%. In a multiple dose study conducted with a research formulation which is less bioavailable than the tablet or suspension, there was little accumulation of drug in serum or urine after dosing for 14 days. Adequate data on CSF levels of cefixime are not available. Metabolism and Excretion There is no evidence of metabolism of cefixime in vivo. Approximately 50% of the absorbed dose is excreted unchanged in the urine in 24 hours. In animal studies, it was noted that cefixime is also excreted in the bile in excess of 10% of the administered dose. The serum half-life of cefixime in healthy subjects is independent of dosage form and averages 3 to 4 hours but may range up to 9 hours in some normal volunteers. Special Populations Geriatrics: Average AUCs at steady state in elderly patients are approximately 40% higher than average AUCs in other healthy adults. Differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters between 12 young and 12 elderly subjects who received 400 mg of cefixime once daily for 5 days are summarized as follows:

 However, these increases were not clinically significant [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2)]. Renal Impairment: In subjects with moderate impairment of renal function (20 to 40 mL/min creatinine clearance), the average serum half-life of cefixime is prolonged to 6.4 hours. In severe renal impairment (5 to 20 mL/min creatinine clearance), the half-life increased to an average of 11.5 hours. The drug is not cleared significantly from the blood by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. However, a study indicated that with doses of 400 mg, patients undergoing hemodialysis have similar blood profiles as subjects with creatinine clearances of 21 to 60 mL/min. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action As with other cephalosporins, the bactericidal action of cefixime results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Cefixime is stable in the presence of certain beta-lactamase enzymes. As a result, certain organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalosporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases may be susceptible to cefixime. Resistance Resistance to cefixime in isolates of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae is most often associated with alterations in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Cefixime may have limited activity against Enterobacteriaceae producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). Pseudomonas species, Enterococcus species, strains of Group D streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, most strains of staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), most strains of Enterobacter species, most strains of Bacteroides fragilis, and most strains of Clostridium species are resistant to cefixime. Antimicrobial Activity Cefixime has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see INDICATIONS AND USAGE (1)]. Gram-positive Bacteria: Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Gram-negative Bacteria: Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae Moraxella catarrhalis Neisseria gonorrhoeae Proteus mirabilis The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for cefixime against isolates of similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of cefixime in treating clinical infections due to these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive Bacteria: Streptococcus agalactiae Gram-negative Bacteria: Citrobacter amalonaticus Citrobacter diversus Haemophilus parainfluenzae Klebsiella oxytoca Klebsiella pneumoniae Pasteurella multocida Proteus vulgaris Providencia species Salmonella species Serratia marcescens Shigella species Susceptibility Test Methods When available, the clinical microbiology laboratory should provide cumulative reports of in vitro susceptibility test results for antimicrobial drugs used in local hospitals and practice areas to the physician as periodic reports that describe the susceptibility profile of nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens. These reports should aid the physician in selecting an antibacterial drug for treatment. Dilution Techniques: Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized test method1,2(broth and/or agar). The MIC values should be interpreted according to criteria provided in Table 3. Diffusion Techniques: Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters can also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The zone size should be determined using a standardized test method.2.3 This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 5 mcg cefixime to test the susceptibility of bacteria to cefixime. The disc diffusion breakpoints are provided in Table 3.

 A report of Susceptible (S) indicates that the antimicrobial drug is likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial drug reaches the concentration usually achievable at the site of infection. A report of Intermediate (I) indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where a high dosage of the drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of Resistant (R) indicates that the antimicrobial drug is not likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial drug reaches the concentration usually achievable at the infection site; other therapy should be selected. Quality Control: Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory controls to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of supplies and reagents used in the assay, and the techniques of the individuals performing the test.1,2,3 Standard cefixime powder should provide the following range of MIC values noted in Table 4. For the diffusion technique using the 5 mcg disk, the criteria in Table 4 should be achieved.

 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Lifetime studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been conducted. Cefixime did not cause point mutations in bacteria or mammalian cells, DNA damage, or chromosome damage in vitro and did not exhibit clastogenic potential in vivo in the mouse micronucleus test. In rats, fertility and reproductive performance were not affected by cefixime at doses up to 25 times the adult therapeutic dose. 14 CLINICAL STUDIES Comparative clinical trials of otitis media were conducted in nearly 400 children between the ages of 6 months to 10 years. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from 47% of the patients, Haemophilus influenzae from 34%, Moraxella catarrhalis from 15% and S. pyogenes from 4%. The overall response rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae to cefixime was approximately 10% lower and that of Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella  catarrhalis approximately 7% higher (12% when beta-lactamase positive isolates of H. influenzae are included) than the response rates of these organisms to the active control drugs. In these studies, patients were randomized and treated with either cefixime at dose regimens of 4 mg/kg twice a day or 8 mg/kg once a day, or with a comparator. Sixty-nine to 70% of the patients in each group had resolution of signs and symptoms of otitis media when evaluated 2 to 4 weeks post-treatment, but persistent effusion was found in 15% of the patients. When evaluated at the completion of therapy, 17% of patients receiving cefixime and 14% of patients receiving effective comparative drugs (18% including those patients who had Haemophilus influenzae resistant to the control drug and who received the control antibiotic) were considered to be treatment failures. By the 2 to 4 week follow-up, a total of 30%-31% of patients had evidence of either treatment failure or recurrent disease. 



 (a)Number eradicated/number isolated. 

 (b)An additional 20 beta-lactamase positive isolates of Haemophilus influenzae were isolated, but were excluded from this analysis because they were resistant to the control antibiotic. In nineteen of these, the clinical course could be assessed and a favorable outcome occurred in 10. When these cases are included in the overall bacteriological evaluation of therapy with the control drugs, 140/185 (76%) of pathogens were considered to be eradicated.

 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION 17.1 Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including cefixime, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When cefixime is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by cefixime for oral suspension or cefixime chewable tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Phenylketonurics: Suprax (cefixime) Chewable Tablets contains 3.3 mg, 5 mg and 6.7 mg of phenylalanine per 100 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg strength, respectively. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antimicrobial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Suprax (cefixime) is a cephalosporin antibacterial drug indicated in the treatment of adults and pediatric patients six months of age or older with the following infections when caused by susceptible isolates of the designated bacteria: 1.1 Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections caused by Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis. 1.2 Otitis Media Otitis Media caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. (Efficacy for Streptococcus pyogenes in this organ system was studied in fewer than 10 infections.) Note: For patients with otitis media caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, overall response was approximately 10% lower for cefixime than for the comparator [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14)].  1.3 Pharyngitis and Tonsillitis Pharyngitis and Tonsillitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. (Note: Penicillin is the usual drug of choice in the treatment of Streptococcus pyogenes infections. Suprax is generally effective in the eradication of Streptococcus pyogenes from the nasopharynx; however, data establishing the efficacy of Suprax in the subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever is not available.) 1.4 Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. 1.5 Uncomplicated Gonorrhea (cervical/urethral) Uncomplicated Gonorrhea (cervical/urethral) caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae (penicillinase-and non-penicillinase-producing isolates). 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION   Adults: 400 mg daily (2.1)   Children: 8 mg/kg/day (2.2) 2.1 Adults The recommended dose of cefixime is 400 mg daily. This may be given as a 400 mg tablet or capsule daily or the 400 mg tablet may be split and given as one half tablet every 12 hours. For the treatment of uncomplicated cervical/urethral gonococcal infections, a single oral dose of 400 mg is recommended. The capsule and tablet may be administered without regard to food. In the treatment of infections due to Streptococcus pyogenes, a therapeutic dosage of cefixime should be administered for at least 10 days. 2.2 Pediatric Patients (6 months or older) The recommended dose is 8 mg/kg/day of the suspension. This may be administered as a single daily dose or may be given in two divided doses, as 4 mg/kg every 12 hours. Note: A suggested dose has been determined for each pediatric weight range. Refer to Table 1. Ensure all orders that specify a dose in milliliters include a concentration, because Suprax for oral suspension is available in three different concentrations (100 mg/5 mL, 200 mg/5 mL, and 500 mg/5 mL).

 Children weighing more than 45 kg or older than 12 years should be treated with the recommended adult dose. Suprax (cefixime) Chewable Tablets must be chewed or crushed before swallowing. Otitis media should be treated with the chewable tablets or suspension. Clinical trials of otitis media were conducted with the chewable tablets or suspension, and the chewable tablets or suspension results in higher peak blood levels than the tablet when administered at the same dose. Therefore, the tablet or capsule should not be substituted for the chewable tablets or suspension in the treatment of otitis media [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. In the treatment of infections due to Streptococcus pyogenes, a therapeutic dosage of cefixime should be administered for at least 10 days. 2.3 Renal Impairment Suprax may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Normal dose and schedule may be employed in patients with creatinine clearances of 60 mL/min or greater. Refer to Table 2 for dose adjustments for adults with renal impairment. Neither hemodialysis nor peritoneal dialysis removes significant amounts of drug from the body.

(4) Suprax (cefixime) is contraindicated in patients with known allergy to cefixime or other cephalosporins. 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity reactions including shock and fatalities have been reported with cefixime. Discontinue use if a reaction occurs. (5.1) Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea: Evaluate if diarrhea occurs. (5.2) Phenylketonurics (5.6) 5.1 Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions (including shock and fatalities) have been reported with the use of cefixime. Before therapy with Suprax is instituted, careful inquiry should be made to determine whether the patient has had previous hypersensitivity reactions to cephalosporins, penicillins, or other drugs. If this product is to be given to penicillin-sensitive patients, caution should be exercised because cross hypersensitivity among beta-lactam antibiotics has been clearly documented and may occur in up to 10% of patients with a history of penicillin allergy. If an allergic reaction to Suprax occurs, discontinue the drug. 5.2 Clostridium difficile-Associated Diarrhea Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Suprax, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing isolates of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. 5.3 Dose Adjustment in Renal Impairment The dose of Suprax should be adjusted in patients with renal impairment as well as those undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and hemodialysis (HD). Patients on dialysis should be monitored carefully [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2)]. 5.4 Coagulation Effects Cephalosporins, including Suprax, may be associated with a fall in prothrombin activity. Those at risk include patients with renal or hepatic impairment, or poor nutritional state, as well as patients receiving a protracted course of antimicrobial therapy, and patients previously stabilized on anticoagulant therapy. Prothrombin time should be monitored in patients at risk and exogenous vitamin K administered as indicated. 5.5 Development of Drug-Resistant Bacteria Prescribing Suprax (cefixime) in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. 
                        5.6 Phenylketonurics
                     Suprax (cefixime) Chewable Tablets contain aspartame, a source of phenylalanine. 100 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg strength contains 3.3 mg, 5 mg and 6.7 mg of phenylalanine, respectively. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions are gastrointestinal such as diarrhea (16%), nausea (7%), loose stools (6%), abdominal pain (3%), dyspepsia (3%), and vomiting. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lupin Pharma at 1-800-399-2561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most commonly seen adverse reactions in U.S. trials of the tablet formulation were gastrointestinal events, which were reported in 30% of adult patients on either the twice daily or the once daily regimen. Five percent (5%) of patients in the U.S. clinical trials discontinued therapy because of drug-related adverse reactions. Individual adverse reactions included diarrhea 16%, loose or frequent stools 6%, abdominal pain 3%, nausea 7%, dyspepsia 3%, and flatulence 4%. The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including diarrhea and loose stools, in pediatric patients receiving the suspension was comparable to the incidence seen in adult patients receiving tablets. 6.2 Post-marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been reported following the use of cefixime. Incidence rates were less than 1 in 50 (less than 2%). Gastrointestinal Several cases of documented pseudomembranous colitis were identified in clinical trials. The onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after therapy. Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions (including shock and fatalities), skin rashes, urticaria, drug fever, pruritus, angioedema, and facial edema. Erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and serum sickness-like reactions have been reported. Hepatic Transient elevations in SGPT, SGOT, alkaline phosphatase, hepatitis, jaundice. Renal Transient elevations in BUN or creatinine, acute renal failure. Central Nervous System Headaches, dizziness, seizures. Hemic and Lymphatic System Transient thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, prolongation in prothrombin time, elevated LDH, pancytopenia, agranulocytosis, and eosinophilia. Abnormal Laboratory Tests Hyperbilirubinemia. Other Adverse Reactions Genital pruritus, vaginitis, candidiasis, toxic epidermal necrolysis. Adverse Reactions Reported for Cephalosporin-class Drugs Allergic reactions, superinfection, renal dysfunction, toxic nephropathy, hepatic dysfunction including cholestasis, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, and colitis. Several cephalosporins have been implicated in triggering seizures, particularly in patients with renal impairment when the dosage was not reduced [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2) and OVERDOSAGE (10)]. If seizures associated with drug therapy occur, the drug should be discontinued. Anticonvulsant therapy can be given if clinically indicated. 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS   Elevated carbamazepine levels have been reported in postmarketing experience when cefixime is administered concomitantly. (7.1)   Increased prothrombin time, with or without clinical bleeding, has been reported when cefixime is administered concomitantly with warfarin and anticoagulants. (7.2) 7.1 Carbamazepine Elevated carbamazepine levels have been reported in postmarketing experience when cefixime is administered concomitantly. Drug monitoring may be of assistance in detecting alterations in carbamazepine plasma concentrations. 7.2 Warfarin and Anticoagulants Increased prothrombin time, with or without clinical bleeding, has been reported when cefixime is administered concomitantly. 7.3 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions A false-positive reaction for ketones in the urine may occur with tests using nitroprusside but not with those using nitroferricyanide. The administration of cefixime may result in a false-positive reaction for glucose in the urine using Clinitest®**, Benedict's solution, or Fehling's solution. It is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix®** or TesTape®**) be used. A false-positive direct Coombs test has been reported during treatment with other cephalosporins; therefore, it should be recognized that a positive Coombs test may be due to the drug. **Clinitest® and Clinistix® are registered trademarks of Ames Division, Miles Laboratories, Inc. Tes-Tape® is a registered trademark of Eli Lilly and Company. 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS   Pregnancy: Cefixime should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. (8.1)   Nursing Mothers: Consideration should be given to discontinuing nursing temporarily during treatment with cefixime. (8.3)   Children: Efficacy and safety in infants aged less than six months have not been established. (8.4)   Geriatric Use: Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. (8.5)   Renal Impairment: Cefixime may be administered in the presence of impaired renal function. Dose adjustment is required in patients whose creatinine clearance is less than 60 mL/min. (8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category B Reproduction studies have been performed in mice and rats at doses up to 40 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to cefixime. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. 8.2 Labor and Delivery Cefixime has not been studied for use during labor and delivery. Treatment should only be given if clearly needed. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether cefixime is excreted in human milk. Consideration should be given to discontinuing nursing temporarily during treatment with this drug. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of cefixime in children aged less than six months old have not been established. The incidence of gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including diarrhea and loose stools, in the pediatric patients receiving the suspension, was comparable to the incidence seen in adult patients receiving tablets. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. A pharmacokinetic study in the elderly detected differences in pharmacokinetic parameters [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)]. These differences were small and do not indicate a need for dosage adjustment of the drug in the elderly. 8.6 Renal Impairment The dose of cefixime should be adjusted in patients with renal impairment as well as those undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and hemodialysis (HD). Patients on dialysis should be monitored carefully [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2.3)]. 10 OVERDOSAGE Gastric lavage may be indicated; otherwise, no specific antidote exists. Cefixime is not removed in significant quantities from the circulation by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Adverse reactions in small numbers of healthy adult volunteers receiving single doses up to 2 g of cefixime did not differ from the profile seen in patients treated at the recommended doses. 11 DESCRIPTION Cefixime is a semisynthetic, cephalosporin antibacterial for oral administration.

Cefixime USP 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Cefixime is a semisynthetic cephalosporin antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Suprax chewable tablets are bioequivalent to oral suspension. Suprax tablets and suspension, given orally, are about 40% to 50% absorbed whether administered with or without food; however, time to maximal absorption is increased approximately 0.8 hours when administered with food. A single 200 mg tablet of cefixime produces an average peak serum concentration of approximately 2 mcg/mL (range 1 to 4 mcg/mL); a single 400 mg tablet produces an average peak concentration of approximately 3.7 mcg/mL (range 1.3 to 7.7 mcg/mL). The oral suspension produces average peak concentrations approximately 25% to 50% higher than the tablets, when tested in normal adult volunteers. Two hundred and 400 mg doses of oral suspension produce average peak concentrations of 3 mcg/mL (range 1 to 4.5 mcg/mL) and 4.6 mcg/mL (range 1.9 to 7.7 mcg/mL), respectively, when tested in normal adult volunteers. The area under the time versus concentration curve (AUC) is greater by approximately 10% to 25% with the oral suspension than with the tablet after doses of 100 to 400 mg, when tested in normal adult volunteers. This increased absorption should be taken into consideration if the oral suspension is to be substituted for the tablet. Because of the lack of bioequivalence, tablets should not be substituted for oral suspension in the treatment of otitis media [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2)]. Cross-over studies of tablet versus suspension have not been performed in children. The 400 mg capsule is bioequivalent to the 400 mg tablet under fasting conditions. However, food reduces the absorption following administration of the capsule by approximately 15% based on AUC and 25% based on Cmax. Peak serum concentrations occur between 2 and 6 hours following oral administration of a single 200 mg tablet, a single 400 mg tablet or 400 mg of cefixime suspension. Peak serum concentrations occur between 2 and 5 hours following a single administration of 200 mg of suspension. Peak serum concentrations occur between 3 and 8 hours following oral administration of a single 400 mg capsule. Distribution Serum protein binding is concentration independent with a bound fraction of approximately 65%. In a multiple dose study conducted with a research formulation which is less bioavailable than the tablet or suspension, there was little accumulation of drug in serum or urine after dosing for 14 days. Adequate data on CSF levels of cefixime are not available. Metabolism and Excretion There is no evidence of metabolism of cefixime in vivo. Approximately 50% of the absorbed dose is excreted unchanged in the urine in 24 hours. In animal studies, it was noted that cefixime is also excreted in the bile in excess of 10% of the administered dose. The serum half-life of cefixime in healthy subjects is independent of dosage form and averages 3 to 4 hours but may range up to 9 hours in some normal volunteers. Special Populations Geriatrics: Average AUCs at steady state in elderly patients are approximately 40% higher than average AUCs in other healthy adults. Differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters between 12 young and 12 elderly subjects who received 400 mg of cefixime once daily for 5 days are summarized as follows:

 A report of Susceptible (S) indicates that the antimicrobial drug is likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial drug reaches the concentration usually achievable at the site of infection. A report of Intermediate (I) indicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where a high dosage of the drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of Resistant (R) indicates that the antimicrobial drug is not likely to inhibit growth of the pathogen if the antimicrobial drug reaches the concentration usually achievable at the infection site; other therapy should be selected. Quality Control: Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory controls to monitor and ensure the accuracy and precision of supplies and reagents used in the assay, and the techniques of the individuals performing the test.1,2,3 Standard cefixime powder should provide the following range of MIC values noted in Table 4. For the diffusion technique using the 5 mcg disk, the criteria in Table 4 should be achieved.

 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Lifetime studies in animals to evaluate carcinogenic potential have not been conducted. Cefixime did not cause point mutations in bacteria or mammalian cells, DNA damage, or chromosome damage in vitro and did not exhibit clastogenic potential in vivo in the mouse micronucleus test. In rats, fertility and reproductive performance were not affected by cefixime at doses up to 25 times the adult therapeutic dose. 14 CLINICAL STUDIES Comparative clinical trials of otitis media were conducted in nearly 400 children between the ages of 6 months to 10 years. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated from 47% of the patients, Haemophilus influenzae from 34%, Moraxella catarrhalis from 15% and S. pyogenes from 4%. The overall response rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae to cefixime was approximately 10% lower and that of Haemophilus influenzae or Moraxella catarrhalis approximately 7% higher (12% when beta-lactamase positive isolates of H. influenzae are included) than the response rates of these organisms to the active control drugs. In these studies, patients were randomized and treated with either cefixime at dose regimens of 4 mg/kg twice a day or 8 mg/kg once a day, or with a comparator. Sixty-nine to 70% of the patients in each group had resolution of signs and symptoms of otitis media when evaluated 2 to 4 weeks post-treatment, but persistent effusion was found in 15% of the patients. When evaluated at the completion of therapy, 17% of patients receiving cefixime and 14% of patients receiving effective comparative drugs (18% including those patients who had Haemophilus influenzae resistant to the control drug and who received the control antibiotic) were considered to be treatment failures. By the 2 to 4 week follow-up, a total of 30%-31% of patients had evidence of either treatment failure or recurrent disease. 



 (a)Number eradicated/number isolated. 

 (b)An additional 20 beta-lactamase positive isolates of Haemophilus influenzae were isolated, but were excluded from this analysis because they were resistant to the control antibiotic. In nineteen of these, the clinical course could be assessed and a favorable outcome occurred in 10. When these cases are included in the overall bacteriological evaluation of therapy with the control drugs, 140/185 (76%) of pathogens were considered to be eradicated.

 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION 17.1 Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including cefixime, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When cefixime is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by cefixime for oral suspension or cefixime chewable tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Phenylketonurics: Suprax (cefixime) Chewable Tablets contains 3.3 mg, 5 mg and 6.7 mg of phenylalanine per 100 mg, 150 mg and 200 mg strength, respectively. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, combination oral contraceptives, including Pirmella, should not be used by women who are over 35 years of age and smoke. Patients should be counseled that this product does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases. COMBINED ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES Each of the following products is a combined oral contraceptive containing the progestational compound norethindrone and the estrogenic compound ethinyl estradiol. Pirmella™7/7/7 Tablets: Each white tablet contains 0.5 mg of norethindrone and 0.035 mg of ethinyl estradiol. Inactive ingredients include lactose anhydrous, magnesium stearate and pregelatinized starch. Each light peach tablet contains 0.75 mg of norethindrone and 0.035 mg of ethinyl estradiol. Inactive ingredients include FD&C Yellow No. 6, lactose anhydrous, magnesium stearate and pregelatinized starch. Each peach tablet contains 1 mg of norethindrone and 0.035 mg of ethinyl estradiol. Inactive ingredients include FD&C Yellow No. 6, lactose anhydrous, magnesium stearate and pregelatinized starch. Each green tablet contains only inert ingredients, as follows: D&C Yellow No. 10, FD&C Blue No. 2, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose and pregelatinized starch. Pirmella™1/35 Tablets: Each peach tablet contains 1 mg of norethindrone and 0.035 mg of ethinyl estradiol. Inactive ingredients include FD&C Yellow No. 6, lactose anhydrous, magnesium stearate and pregelatinized starch. Each green tablet contains only inert ingredients, as follows: D&C Yellow No. 10, FD&C Blue No. 2, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose and pregelatinized starch. The chemical name for norethindrone is 17-Hydroxy-19-nor-17α-pregn-4-en-20-yn-3-one, and for ethinyl estradiol is 19-Nor-17α-pregna-1, 3,5(10)-trien-20-yne-3, 17-diol. Their structural formulas are as follows: Norethindrone and Ethinyl Estradiol CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Combined Oral Contraceptives Combined oral contraceptives act by suppression of gonadotropins. Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation). INDICATIONS AND USAGE Pirmella 7/7/7 and Pirmella 1/35 Tablets are indicated for the prevention of pregnancy in women who elect to use this product as a method of contraception. Oral contraceptives are highly effective. Table 1 lists the typical accidental pregnancy rates for users of combined oral contraceptives and other methods of contraception. The efficacy of these contraceptive methods, except sterilization, the IUD, and the NORPLANT® System depends upon the reliability with which they are used. Correct and consistent use of methods can result in lower failure rates.

 ChanceThe percents becoming pregnant in columns (2) and (3) are based on data from populations where contraception is not used and from women who cease using contraception in order to become pregnant. Among such populations, about 89% become pregnant within one year. This estimate was lowered slightly (to 85%) to represent the percent who would become pregnant within one year among women now relying on reversible methods of contraception if they abandoned contraception altogether.

 Pirmella 7/7/7 and Pirmella 1/35 have not been studied for and are not indicated for use in emergency contraception. CONTRAINDICATIONS Oral contraceptives should not be used in women who currently have the following conditions: Thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders A past history of deep vein thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders Known thrombophilic conditions Cerebral vascular or coronary artery disease (current or history) Valvular heart disease with complications Persistent blood pressure values of ≥160 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 100 mg Hg diastolic96 Diabetes with vascular involvement Headaches with focal neurological symptoms Major surgery with prolonged immobilization Known or suspected carcinoma of the breast Carcinoma of the endometrium or other known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding Cholestatic jaundice of pregnancy or jaundice with prior pill use Acute or chronic hepatocellular disease with abnormal liver function Hepatic adenomas or carcinomas Known or suspected pregnancy Hypersensitivity to any component of this product WARNINGS Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events from combination oral contraceptive use. This risk increases with age, particularly in women over 35 years of age, and with the number of cigarettes smoked. For this reason, combination oral contraceptives, including Pirmella, should not be used by women who are over 35 years of age and smoke. Contains color additives including FD&C Yellow No. 6. The use of oral contraceptives is associated with increased risks of several serious conditions including myocardial infarction, thromboembolism, stroke, hepatic neoplasia, and gallbladder disease, although the risk of serious morbidity or mortality is very small in healthy women without underlying risk factors. The risk of morbidity and mortality increases significantly in the presence of other underlying risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemias, obesity and diabetes. Practitioners prescribing oral contraceptives should be familiar with the following information relating to these risks. The information contained in this package insert is principally based on studies carried out in patients who used oral contraceptives with higher formulations of estrogens and progestogens than those in common use today. The effect of long-term use of the oral contraceptives with lower formulations of both estrogens and progestogens remains to be determined. Throughout this labeling, epidemiological studies reported are of two types: retrospective or case control studies and prospective or cohort studies. Case control studies provide a measure of the relative risk of a disease, namely, a ratio of the incidence of a disease among oral contraceptive users to that among nonusers. The relative risk does not provide information on the actual clinical occurrence of a disease. Cohort studies provide a measure of attributable risk, which is the difference in the incidence of disease between oral contraceptive users and nonusers. The attributable risk does provide information about the actual occurrence of a disease in the population (adapted from refs. 2 and 3 with the author's permission). For further information, the reader is referred to a text on epidemiological methods. 1. Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems a. Myocardial Infarction An increased risk of myocardial infarction has been attributed to oral contraceptive use. This risk is primarily in smokers or women with other underlying risk factors for coronary artery disease such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, morbid obesity, and diabetes. The relative risk of heart attack for current oral contraceptive users has been estimated to be two to six.4–10 The risk is very low under the age of 30. Smoking in combination with oral contraceptive use has been shown to contribute substantially to the incidence of myocardial infarctions in women in their mid-thirties or older with smoking accounting for the majority of excess cases.11 Mortality rates associated with circulatory disease have been shown to increase substantially in smokers, especially in those 35 years of age and older, and in nonsmokers over the age of 40 among women who use oral contraceptives. (See Figure 1). Figure 1. Circulatory Disease Mortality Rates per 100,000 Women-Years by Age, Smoking Status and Oral Contraceptive Use Oral contraceptives may compound the effects of well-known risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemias, age and obesity.13 In particular, some progestogens are known to decrease HDL cholesterol and cause glucose intolerance, while estrogens may create a state of hyperinsulinism.14-18 Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase blood pressure among users (see Section 9 in WARNINGS). Similar effects on risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of heart disease. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors. b. Thromboembolism An increased risk of thromboembolic and thrombotic disease associated with the use of oral contraceptives is well established. Case control studies have found the relative risk of users compared to nonusers to be 3 for the first episode of superficial venous thrombosis, 4 to 11 for deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and 1.5 to 6 for women with predisposing conditions for venous thromboembolic disease.2, 3,19-24 Cohort studies have shown the relative risk to be somewhat lower, about 3 for new cases and about 4.5 for new cases requiring hospitalization.25 The risk of thromboembolic disease associated with oral contraceptives gradually disappears after combined oral contraceptive (COC) use is stopped.2VTE risk is highest in the first year of use and when restarting hormonal contraception after a break of four weeks or longer. A two- to four-fold increase in relative risk of post-operative thromboembolic complications has been reported with the use of oral contraceptives.9 The relative risk of venous thrombosis in women who have predisposing conditions is twice that of women without such medical conditions.26 If feasible, oral contraceptives should be discontinued at least four weeks prior to and for two weeks after elective surgery of a type associated with an increase in risk of thromboembolism and during and following prolonged immobilization. Since the immediate postpartum period is also associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, oral contraceptives should be started no earlier than four weeks after delivery in women who elect not to breastfeed. c. Cerebrovascular diseases Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years), hypertensive women who also smoke. Hypertension was found to be a risk factor for both users and nonusers, for both types of strokes, and smoking interacted to increase the risk of stroke.27-29 In a large study, the relative risk of thrombotic strokes has been shown to range from 3 for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe hypertension.30 The relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke is reported to be 1.2 for non-smokers who used oral contraceptives, 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral contraceptives, 7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for normotensive users and 25.7 for users with severe hypertension.30 The attributable risk is also greater in older women.3 d. Dose-related risk of vascular disease from oral contraceptives A positive association has been observed between the amount of estrogen and progestogen in oral contraceptives and the risk of vascular disease.31–33 A decline in serum high density lipoproteins (HDL) has been reported with many progestational agents.14–16 A decline in serum high density lipoproteins has been associated with an increased incidence of ischemic heart disease. Because estrogens increase HDL cholesterol, the net effect of an oral contraceptive depends on a balance achieved between doses of estrogen and progestogen and the activity of the progestogen used in the contraceptives. The activity and amount of both hormones should be considered in the choice of an oral contraceptive. Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good principles of therapeutics. For any particular estrogen/progestogen combination, the dosage regimen prescribed should be one which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and the needs of the individual patient. New acceptors of oral contraceptive agents should be started on preparations containing the lowest estrogen content which is judged appropriate for the individual patient. e. Persistence of risk of vascular disease There are two studies which have shown persistence of risk of vascular disease for ever-users of oral contraceptives. In a study in the United States, the risk of developing myocardial infarction after discontinuing oral contraceptives persists for at least 9 years for women 40–49 years who had used oral contraceptives for five or more years, but this increased risk was not demonstrated in other age groups.8 In another study in Great Britain, the risk of developing cerebrovascular disease persisted for at least 6 years after discontinuation of oral contraceptives, although excess risk was very small.34 However, both studies were performed with oral contraceptive formulations containing 50 micrograms or higher of estrogens. 2. Estimates of Mortality from Contraceptive Use One study gathered data from a variety of sources which have estimated the mortality rate associated with different methods of contraception at different ages (Table 2). These estimates include the combined risk of death associated with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event of method failure. Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and risks. The study concluded that with the exception of oral contraceptive users 35 and older who smoke, and 40 and older who do not smoke, mortality associated with all methods of birth control is low and below that associated with childbirth. The observation of an increase in risk of mortality with age for oral contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970's. 35 Current clinical recommendation involves the use of lower estrogen dose formulations and a careful consideration of risk factors. In 1989, the Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the use of oral contraceptives in women 40 years of age and over. The Committee concluded that although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy non-smoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are also greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical procedures which may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective and acceptable means of contraception. The Committee recommended that the benefits of low-dose oral contraceptive use by healthy non-smoking women over 40 may outweigh the possible risks. Of course, older women, as all women who take oral contraceptives, should take an oral contraceptive which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and individual patient needs.

 3. Carcinoma of the Reproductive Organs and Breasts Numerous epidemiological studies have been performed on the incidence of breast, endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancer in women using oral contraceptives. The risk of having breast cancer diagnosed may be slightly increased among current and recent users of COCs. However, this excess risk appears to decrease over time after COC discontinuation and by 10 years after cessation the increased risk disappears. Some studies report an increased risk with duration of use while other studies do not and no consistent relationships have been found with dose or type of steroid. Some studies have found a small increase in risk for women who first use COCs before age 20. Most studies show a similar pattern of risk with COC use regardless of a woman's reproductive history or her family breast cancer history. Breast cancers diagnosed in current or previous OC users tend to be less clinically advanced than in nonusers. Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use oral contraceptives because breast cancer is usually a hormonally-sensitive tumor. Some studies suggest that oral contraceptive use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in some populations of women.45-48 However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. In spite of many studies of the relationship between oral contraceptive use and breast and cervical cancers, a cause-and-effect relationship has not been established. 4. Hepatic Neoplasia Benign hepatic adenomas are associated with oral contraceptive use, although the incidence of benign tumors is rare in the United States. Indirect calculations have estimated the attributable risk to be in the range of 3.3 cases/100,000 for users, a risk that increases after four or more years of use especially with oral contraceptives of higher dose.49 Rupture of benign, hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage.50, 51  Studies from Britain have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) oral contraceptive users. However, these cancers are extremely rare in the U.S. and the attributable risk (the excess incidence) of liver cancers in oral contraceptive users approaches less than one per million users. 5. Ocular Lesions There have been clinical case reports of retinal thrombosis associated with the use of oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptives should be discontinued if there is unexplained partial or complete loss of vision; onset of proptosis or diplopia; papilledema; or retinal vascular lesions. Appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures should be undertaken immediately. 6. Oral Contraceptive Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy.56, 57 The majority of recent studies also do not indicate a teratogenic effect, particularly in so far as cardiac anomalies and limb reduction defects are concerned, 55,56,58,59 when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy. Oral contraceptives should not be used during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion. It is recommended that for any patient who has missed two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period. Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed. 7. Gallbladder Disease Earlier studies have reported an increased lifetime relative risk of gallbladder surgery in users of oral contraceptives and estrogens.60, 61 More recent studies, however, have shown that the relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among oral contraceptive users may be minimal.62-64 The recent findings of minimal risk may be related to the use of oral contraceptive formulations containing lower hormonal doses of estrogens and progestogens. 8. Carbohydrate and Lipid Metabolic Effects Oral contraceptives have been shown to cause a decrease in glucose tolerance in a significant percentage of users.17 This effect has been shown to be directly related to estrogen dose.65 Progestogens increase insulin secretion and create insulin resistance, this effect varying with different progestational agents.17, 66 However, in the non-diabetic woman, oral contraceptives appear to have no effect on fasting blood glucose.67 Because of these demonstrated effects, prediabetic and diabetic women in particular should be carefully monitored while taking oral contraceptives. A small proportion of women will have persistent hypertriglyceridemia while on the pill. As discussed earlier (see WARNINGS 1a and 1d ), changes in serum triglycerides and lipoprotein levels have been reported in oral contraceptive users. 9. Elevated Blood Pressure Women with significant hypertension should not be started on hormonal contraception.92 An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking oral contraceptives68 and this increase is more likely in older oral contraceptive users69 and with extended duration of use.61 Data from the Royal College of General Practitioners12 and subsequent randomized trials have shown that the incidence of hypertension increases with increasing progestational activity. Women with a history of hypertension or hypertension-related diseases, or renal disease70 should be encouraged to use another method of contraception. If these women elect to use oral contraceptives, they should be monitored closely and if a clinically significant persistent elevation of blood pressure (BP) occurs (≥ 160 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 100 mm Hg diastolic) and cannot be adequately controlled, oral contraceptives should be discontinued. In general, women who develop hypertension during hormonal contraceptive therapy should be switched to a non-hormonal contraceptive. If other contraceptive methods are not suitable, hormonal contraceptive therapy may continue combined with antihypertensive therapy. Regular monitoring of BP throughout hormonal contraceptive therapy is recommended.96 For most women, elevated blood pressure will return to normal after stopping oral contraceptives, and there is no difference in the occurrence of hypertension between former and never users.68-71 10. Headache The onset or exacerbation of migraine or development of headache with a new pattern which is recurrent, persistent or severe requires discontinuation of oral contraceptives and evaluation of the cause. 11. Bleeding Irregularities Breakthrough bleeding and spotting are sometimes encountered in patients on oral contraceptives, especially during the first three months of use. Nonhormonal causes should be considered and adequate diagnostic measures taken to rule out malignancy or pregnancy in the event of breakthrough bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. In the event of amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was preexistent. 12. Ectopic Pregnancy Ectopic as well as intrauterine pregnancy may occur in contraceptive failures. Figure 1 PRECAUTIONS 1. General Patients should be counseled that this product does not protect against HIV infection (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases. 2. Physical Examination and Follow-Up It is good medical practice for all women to have annual history and physical examinations, including women using oral contraceptives. The physical examination, however, may be deferred until after initiation of oral contraceptives if requested by the woman and judged appropriate by the clinician. The physical examination should include special reference to blood pressure, breasts, abdomen and pelvic organs, including cervical cytology, and relevant laboratory tests. In case of undiagnosed, persistent or recurrent abnormal vaginal bleeding, appropriate measures should be conducted to rule out malignancy. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer or who have breast nodules should be monitored with particular care. 3. Lipid Disorders Women who are being treated for hyperlipidemias should be followed closely if they elect to use oral contraceptives. Some progestogens may elevate LDL levels and may render the control of hyperlipidemias more difficult. 4. Liver Function If jaundice develops in any woman receiving such drugs, the medication should be discontinued. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. 5. Fluid Retention Oral contraceptives may cause some degree of fluid retention. They should be prescribed with caution, and only with careful monitoring, in patients with conditions which might be aggravated by fluid retention. 6. Emotional Disorders Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and the drug discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. 7. Contact Lenses Contact lens wearers who develop visual changes or changes in lens tolerance should be assessed by an ophthalmologist. 8. Drug Interactions Consult the labeling of concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations. Effects of Other Drugs on Combined Hormonal Contraceptives Substances decreasing the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminishing the efficacy of COCs: Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, including cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), may decrease the plasma concentrations of COCs and potentially diminish the effectiveness of CHCs or increase breakthrough bleeding. Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness  of  hormonal  contraceptives include phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between hormonal contraceptives and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive  failure. Counsel women to use an alternative method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with CHCs, and to continue back-up contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability. Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of COCs: Co-administration of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin and certain COCs containing EE increase AUC values for EE by approximately 20 to 25%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen may increase plasma EE concentrations, possibly by inhibition of conjugation. CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase plasma hormone concentrations. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors: Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of estrogen and/or progestin have been noted in some cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir]) /HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). Colesevelam  Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant, given together with a combination oral hormonal contraceptive, has been shown to significantly decrease the AUC of EE. A drug interaction between the contraceptive and colesevelam was decreased when the two drug products were given 4 hours apart. Effects of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives on Other Drugs COCs containing EE may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds (e.g., cyclosporine, prednisolone, theophylline, tizanidine, and voriconazole) and increase their plasma concentrations. COCs have been shown to decrease plasma concentrations of acetaminophen, clofibric acid, morphine, salicylic acid, temazepam and lamotrigine. Significant decrease in plasma concentration of lamotrigine has been shown, likely due to induction of lamotrigine glucuronidation. This may reduce seizure control; therefore, dosage adjustments of lamotrigine may be necessary. Women on thyroid hormone replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone because serum concentrations of thyroid-binding globulin increases with use of COCs. 9. Interactions with Laboratory Tests Certain endocrine and liver function tests and blood components may be affected by oral contraceptives: a. Increased prothrombin and factors VII, VIII, IX, and X; decreased antithrombin 3; increased norepinephrine-induced platelet aggregability. b. Increased thyroid binding globulin (TBG) leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T4 by column or by radioimmunoassay. Free T3 resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG, free T4 concentration is unaltered. c. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum. d. Sex-binding globulins are increased and result in elevated levels of total circulating sex steroids and corticoids; however, free or biologically active levels remain unchanged. e. Triglycerides may be increased and levels of various other lipids and lipoproteins may be affected. f. Glucose tolerance may be decreased. g. Serum folate levels may be depressed by oral contraceptive therapy. This may be of clinical significance if a woman becomes pregnant shortly after discontinuing oral contraceptives. 10. Carcinogenesis See WARNINGS . 11. Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X. See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS . 12. Nursing Mothers Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids have been identified in the milk of nursing mothers and a few adverse effects on the child have been reported, including jaundice and breast enlargement. In addition, combined oral contraceptives given in the postpartum period may interfere with lactation by decreasing the quantity and quality of breast milk. If possible, the nursing mother should be advised not to use combined oral contraceptives but to use other forms of contraception until she has completely weaned her child. 13. Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy of Pirmella Tablets have been established in women of reproductive age. Safety and efficacy are expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 16 and for users 16 years and older. Use of this product before menarche is not indicated. 14. Geriatric Use This product has not been studied in women over 65 years of age and is not indicated in this population. INFORMATION FOR THE PATIENT See Patient Labeling printed below. ADVERSE REACTIONS An increased risk of the following serious adverse reactions has been associated with the use of oral contraceptives (See WARNINGS ). Thrombophlebitis and venous thrombosis with or without embolism Arterial thromboembolism Pulmonary embolism Myocardial infarction Cerebral hemorrhage Cerebral thrombosis Hypertension Gallbladder disease Hepatic adenomas or benign liver tumors There is evidence of an association between the following conditions and the use of oral contraceptives: Mesenteric thrombosis Retinal thrombosis The following adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving oral contraceptives and are believed to be drug-related: Nausea Vomiting Gastrointestinal symptoms (such as abdominal cramps and bloating) Breakthrough bleeding Spotting Change in menstrual flow Amenorrhea Temporary infertility after discontinuation of treatment Edema Melasma which may persist Breast changes: tenderness, enlargement, secretion Change in weight (increase or decrease) Change in cervical erosion and secretion Diminution in lactation when given immediately postpartum Cholestatic jaundice Migraine Allergic reaction, including rash, urticaria, angioedema Mental depression Reduced tolerance to carbohydrates Vaginal candidiasis Change in corneal curvature (steepening) Intolerance to contact lenses The following adverse reactions have been reported in users of oral contraceptives and a causal association has been neither confirmed nor refuted: Pre-menstrual syndrome Cataracts Changes in appetite Cystitis-like syndrome Headache Nervousness Dizziness Hirsutism Loss of scalp hair Erythema multiforme Erythema nodosum Hemorrhagic eruption Vaginitis Porphyria Impaired renal function Hemolytic uremic syndrome Acne Changes in libido Colitis Budd-Chiari Syndrome The following adverse reactions were also reported in clinical trials or during post-marketing experience: Gastrointestinal Disorders: diarrhea, pancreatitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: muscle spasms, back pain; Reproductive System and Breast Disorders: vulvovaginal pruritus, pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, vulvovaginal dryness; Psychiatric Disorders: anxiety, mood swings, mood altered; Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: pruritus, photosensitivity reaction; General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: edema peripheral, fatigue, irritability, asthenia, malaise; Neoplasms Benign, Malignant, and Unspecified (Including Cysts and Polyps): breast cancer, breast mass, breast neoplasm, cervix carcinoma; Immune System Disorders: anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction; Hepatobiliary Disorders: hepatitis, cholelithiasis. OVERDOSAGE Serious ill effects have not been reported following acute ingestion of large doses of oral contraceptives by young children. Overdosage may cause nausea, and withdrawal bleeding may occur in females. NON-CONTRACEPTIVE HEALTH BENEFITS The following non-contraceptive health benefits related to the use of combined oral contraceptives are supported by epidemiological studies which largely utilized oral contraceptive formulations containing estrogen doses exceeding 0.035 mg of ethinyl estradiol or 0.05 mg mestranol.73-78 Effects on menses: increased menstrual cycle regularity decreased blood loss and decreased incidence of iron deficiency anemia decreased incidence of dysmenorrhea Effects related to inhibition of ovulation: decreased incidence of functional ovarian cysts decreased incidence of ectopic pregnancies Other effects: decreased incidence of fibroadenomas and fibrocystic disease of the breast decreased incidence of acute pelvic inflammatory disease decreased incidence of endometrial cancer decreased incidence of ovarian cancer DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, Pirmella Tablets must be taken exactly as directed and at intervals not exceeding 24 hours. Pirmella Tablets are available in a wallet which is preset for Sunday Start. Day 1 Start is available. Sunday Start When taking Pirmella 7/7/7 and Pirmella 1/35, the first ""active"" tablet should be taken on the first Sunday after menstruation begins. If the period begins on Sunday, the first ""active"" tablet should be taken that day. Take one active tablet daily for 21 days followed by one green ""reminder"" tablet daily for 7 days. After 28 tablets have been taken, a new course is started the next day (Sunday). For the first cycle of a Sunday Start regimen, another method of contraception such as a condom or spermicide should be used until after the first 7 consecutive days of administration. If the patient misses one (1) ""active"" tablet in Weeks 1, 2, or 3, the tablet should be taken as soon as she remembers. If the patient misses two (2) ""active"" tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take two (2) tablets the day she remembers and two (2) tablets the next day; and then continue taking one (1) tablet a day until she finishes the pack. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control such as a condom or spermicide if she has sex in the seven (7) days after missing pills. If the patient misses two (2) ""active"" tablets in the third week or misses three (3) or more ""active"" tablets in a row, the patient should continue taking one tablet every day until Sunday. On Sunday the patient should throw out the rest of the pack and start a new pack that same day. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control if she has sex in the seven (7) days after missing pills. Complete instructions to facilitate patient counseling on proper pill usage may be found in the Detailed Patient Labeling (""How to Take the Pill"" section). Day 1 Start The dosage of Pirmella 7/7/7 and Pirmella 1/35, for the initial cycle of therapy, is one ""active"" tablet administered daily from the 1st through the 21st day of the menstrual cycle, counting the first day of menstrual flow as ""Day 1"" followed by one green ""reminder"" tablet daily for 7 days. Tablets are taken without interruption for 28 days. After 28 tablets have been taken, a new course is started the next day. If the patient misses one (1) ""active"" tablet in Weeks 1, 2, or 3, the tablet should be taken as soon as she remembers. If the patient misses two (2) ""active"" tablets in Week 1 or Week 2, the patient should take two (2) tablets the day she remembers and two (2) tablets the next day; and then continue taking one (1) tablet a day until she finishes the pack. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control such as a condom or spermicide if she has sex in the seven (7) days after missing pills. If the patient misses two (2) ""active"" tablets in the third week or misses three (3) or more ""active"" tablets in a row, the patient should throw out the rest of the pack and start a new pack that same day. The patient should be instructed to use a back-up method of birth control if she has sex in the seven (7) days after missing pills. Complete instructions to facilitate patient counseling on proper pill usage may be found in the Detailed Patient Labeling (""How to Take the Pill"" section). The use of Pirmella 7/7/7 and Pirmella 1/35 for contraception may be initiated 4 weeks postpartum in women who elect not to breastfeed. When the tablets are administered during the postpartum period, the increased risk of thromboembolic disease associated with the postpartum period must be considered. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS concerning thromboembolic disease. See also PRECAUTIONS:  Nursing Mothers ). The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered. (See Discussion of Dose-Related Risk of Vascular Disease from Oral Contraceptives). ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS Breakthrough bleeding, spotting, and amenorrhea are frequent reasons for patients discontinuing oral contraceptives. In breakthrough bleeding, as in all cases of irregular bleeding from the vagina, nonfunctional causes should be borne in mind. In undiagnosed persistent or recurrent abnormal bleeding from the vagina, adequate diagnostic measures are indicated to rule out pregnancy or malignancy. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. Changing to an oral contraceptive with a higher estrogen content, while potentially useful in minimizing menstrual irregularity, should be done only if necessary since this may increase the risk of thromboembolic disease. Use of oral contraceptives in the event of a missed menstrual period: 1. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed. 2. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out.

The typical failure rate is approximately 5% per year when women who miss pills are included. For most women oral contraceptives are also free of serious or unpleasant side effects. However, forgetting to take pills considerably increases the chances of pregnancy. For the majority of women, oral contraceptives can be taken safely. But there are some women who are at high risk of developing certain serious diseases that can be fatal or may cause temporary or permanent disability. The risks associated with taking oral contraceptives increase significantly if you: smoke have high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol have or have had clotting disorders, heart attack, stroke, angina pectoris, cancer of the breast or sex organs, jaundice or malignant or benign liver tumors. Although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy, non-smoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are also greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women. You should not take the pill if you suspect you are pregnant or have unexplained vaginal bleeding. Do not use Pirmella if you smoke cigarettes and are over 35 years old. Smoking increases your risk of serious cardiovascular side effects (heart and blood vessel problems) from combination oral contraceptives, including death from heart attack, blood clots or stroke. This risk increases with age and the number of cigarettes you smoke. Most side effects of the pill are not serious. The most common such effects are nausea, vomiting, bleeding between menstrual periods, weight gain, breast tenderness, and difficulty wearing contact lenses. These side effects, especially nausea and vomiting, may subside within the first three months of use. The serious side effects of the pill occur very infrequently, especially if you are in good health and are young. However, you should know that the following medical conditions have been associated with or made worse by the pill: 1. Blood clots in the legs (thrombophlebitis), lungs (pulmonary embolism), stoppage or rupture of a blood vessel in the brain (stroke), blockage of blood vessels in the heart (heart attack or angina pectoris) or other organs of the body. As mentioned above, smoking increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes and subsequent serious medical consequences. 2. In rare cases, oral contraceptives can cause benign but dangerous liver tumors. These benign liver tumors can rupture and cause fatal internal bleeding. In addition, some studies report an increased risk of developing liver cancer. However, liver cancers are rare. 3. High blood pressure, although blood pressure usually returns to normal when the pill is stopped. The symptoms associated with these serious side effects are discussed in the detailed leaflet given to you with your supply of pills. Notify your healthcare professional if you notice any unusual physical disturbances while taking the pill. In addition, drugs such as rifampin, bosentan, as well as some seizure medicines and herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may decrease oral contraceptive effectiveness. Oral contraceptives may interact with lamotrigine (LAMICTAL®), a seizure medicine used for epilepsy. This may increase the risk of seizures so your healthcare professional may need to adjust the dose of lamotrigine. Various studies give conflicting reports on the relationship between breast cancer and oral contraceptive use. Oral contraceptive use may slightly increase your chance of having breast cancer diagnosed, particularly after using hormonal contraceptives at a younger age. After you stop using hormonal contraceptives, the chances of having breast cancer diagnosed begin to go back down. You should have regular breast examinations by a healthcare professional and examine your own breasts monthly. Tell your healthcare professional if you have a family history of breast cancer or if you have had breast nodules or an abnormal mammogram. Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use oral contraceptives because breast cancer is usually a hormone-sensitive tumor. Some studies have found an increase in the incidence of cancer of the cervix in women who use oral contraceptives. However, this finding may be related to factors other than the use of oral contraceptives. There is insufficient evidence to rule out the possibility that the pill may cause such cancers. Taking the combination pill provides some important non-contraceptive benefits. These include less painful menstruation, less menstrual blood loss and anemia, fewer pelvic infections, and fewer cancers of the ovary and the lining of the uterus. Be sure to discuss any medical condition you may have with your healthcare professional. Your healthcare professional will take a medical and family history before prescribing oral contraceptives and will examine you. The physical examination may be delayed to another time if you request it and the healthcare professional believes that it is a good medical practice to postpone it. You should be reexamined at least once a year while taking oral contraceptives. Your pharmacist should have given you the detailed patient information labeling which gives you further information which you should read and discuss with your healthcare professional. This product (like all oral contraceptives) is intended to prevent pregnancy. It does not protect against transmission of HIV (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and syphilis. HOW TO TAKE THE PILL 

 IMPORTANT  POINTS  TO  REMEMBER 
 BEFORE YOU START TAKING YOUR PILLS: 1. BE SURE TO READ THESE DIRECTIONS: Before you start taking your pills. Anytime you are not sure what to do. 2. THE RIGHT WAY TO TAKE THE PILL IS TO TAKE ONE PILL EVERY DAY AT THE SAME TIME. If you miss pills you could get pregnant. This includes starting the pack late. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant. 3. MANY WOMEN HAVE SPOTTING OR LIGHT BLEEDING, OR MAY FEEL SICK TO THEIR STOMACH DURING THE FIRST 1-3 PACKS OF PILLS. If you feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking the pill. The problem will usually go away. If it doesn't go away, check with your healthcare professional. 4. MISSING PILLS CAN ALSO CAUSE SPOTTING OR LIGHT BLEEDING, even when you make up these missed pills. On the days you take 2 pills to make up for missed pills, you could also feel a little sick to your stomach. 5. IF YOU HAVE VOMITING OR DIARRHEA, or IF YOU TAKE SOME MEDICINES, your pills may not work as well. Use a back-up method (such as a condom or spermicide) until you check with your healthcare professional. 6. IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE REMEMBERING TO TAKE THE PILL, talk to your healthcare professional about how to make pill taking easier or about using another method of birth control. 7. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR ARE UNSURE ABOUT THE INFORMATION IN THIS LEAFLET, call your healthcare professional. 

 BEFORE  YOU  START  TAKING  YOUR  PILLS 
 1. DECIDE WHAT TIME OF DAY YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR PILL. It is important to take it at about the same time every day. 2. LOOK AT YOUR PILL PACK. The pill pack has 21 ""active"" pills (with hormones) to take for 3 weeks. This is followed by 1 week of green ""reminder"" pills (without hormones). Pirmella 7/7/7 : There are 7 white ""active"" pills, 7 light peach ""active"" pills, 7 peach ""active"" pills and 7 green ""reminder"" pills. Pirmella 1/35: There are 21 peach ""active"" pills and 7 green ""reminder"" pills. 3. ALSO FIND: 1) where on the pack to start taking pills, 2) in what order to take the pills. 4. BE SURE YOU HAVE READY AT ALL TIMES: ANOTHER KIND OF BIRTH CONTROL (such as a condom or spermicide) to use as a back-up method in case you miss pills. AN EXTRA, FULL PILL PACK. 

 WHEN  TO  START  THE  FIRST  PACK  OF  PILLS 
 You have a choice of which day to start taking your first pack of pills. Pirmella 7/7/7 and Pirmella 1/35 are available in wallet which is preset for a Sunday Start. Day 1 Start is also provided. Decide with your healthcare professional which is the best day for you. Pick a time of day that will be easy to remember. SUNDAY START: Pirmella 7/7/7 : Take the first white ""active"" pill of the first pack on the Sunday after your period starts , even if you are still bleeding. If your period begins on Sunday, start the pack the same day. Pirmella 1/35: Take the first peach ""active"" pill of the first pack on the Sunday after your period starts, even if you are still bleeding. If your period begins on Sunday, start the pack the same day. Use another method of birth control such as a condom or spermicide as a back-up method if you have sex anytime from the Sunday you start your first pack until the next Sunday (7 days). DAY 1 START: Pirmella 7/7/7 : Take the first white ""active"" pill of the first pack during the first 24 hours of your period. Pirmella 1/35: Take the first peach ""active"" pill of the first pack during the first 24 hours of your period. You will not need to use a back-up method of birth control, since you are starting the pill at the beginning of your period. 

 WHAT  TO  DO  DURING  THE  MONTH 
 1. TAKE ONE PILL AT THE SAME TIME EVERY DAY UNTIL THE PACK IS EMPTY. Do not skip pills even if you are spotting or bleeding between monthly periods or feel sick to your stomach (nausea). Do not skip pills even if you do not have sex very often. 2. WHEN YOU FINISH A PACK OR SWITCH YOUR BRAND OF PILLS: Start the next pack on the day after your last green ""reminder"" pill. Do not wait any days between packs. 

 WHAT  TO  DO  IF  YOU  MISS  PILLS

 INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING YOUR WALLET Please Read Me! □   Sunday Start or □   Day 1 Start There are two ways to start taking birth control pills: Sunday Start or Day 1 Start. Your healthcare provider will tell you which to use. Save these instructions. 1   If this is the first time you are taking birth control pills, or if you have not taken birth control pills for 10 days or more, your first step is to wait until the first day you get your menstrual period. Then, follow these instructions for either Sunday Start or Day 1 Start. 2   When you get your period:    ▪   You will use a Sunday Start if your doctor told you to take your first pill on a Sunday. Take pill ""1"" on the Sunday after your period starts. If your period starts on a Sunday, take pill ""1"" that day.    ▪   You will use a Day 1 Start if your doctor told you to take pill ""1"" on the first day of your period. 3   Set the day:    ▪   Pick the day label strip that starts with the first day of your period. Place this day label strip over the area that has the days of the week (starting with Sunday) pre-printed on the wallet (Refer figure below). 4. Remove pill ""1"" by pushing down on the pill. The pill will come out through a hole in the back of the strip. 5. Swallow the pill. You will take one pill each day. If you use a Sunday Start and you are taking the pill for the FIRST TIME, YOU MUST USE A BACK-UP METHOD OF BIRTH CONTROL FOR THE FIRST 7 DAYS.

Continue to take one pill each day until all the pills have been taken. 7. Take your pill at the same time every day. It is important to take the correct pill each day and not miss any pills. To help you remember, take your pill at the same time as another daily activity, like turning off your alarm clock or brushing your teeth. 8. When your wallet is empty. You will start a new wallet on the day after pill ""28."" 9. THE FIRST PILL IN EVERY WALLET WILL ALWAYS BE TAKEN ON THE SAME DAY OF THE WEEK, NO MATTER WHEN YOUR NEXT PERIOD STARTS. DETAILED PATIENT LABELING PLEASE NOTE : This labeling is revised from time to time as important new medical information becomes available. Therefore, please review this labeling carefully. The following oral contraceptive products contain a combination of an estrogen and progestogen, the two kinds of female hormones: Pirmella 7/7/7 Each white tablet contains 0.5 mg norethindrone and 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol. Each light peach tablet contains 0.75 mg norethindrone and 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol. Each peach tablet contains 1 mg norethindrone and 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol. Each green tablet contains inert ingredients. Pirmella 1/35 Each peach tablet contains 1 mg norethindrone and 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol. Each green tablet contains inert ingredients. INTRODUCTION Any woman who considers using oral contraceptives (the birth control pill or the pill) should understand the benefits and risks of using this form of birth control. This patient labeling will give you much of the information you will need to make this decision and will also help you determine if you are at risk of developing any of the serious side effects of the pill. It will tell you how to use the pill properly so that it will be as effective as possible. However, this labeling is not a replacement for a careful discussion between you and your healthcare professional. You should discuss the information provided in this labeling with him or her, both when you first start taking the pill and during your revisits. You should also follow your healthcare professional's advice with regard to regular check-ups while you are on the pill. EFFECTIVENESS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES Oral contraceptives or ""birth control pills"" or ""the pill"" are used to prevent pregnancy and are more effective than other non-surgical methods of birth control. When they are taken correctly without missing any pills, the chance of becoming pregnant is approximately 1% (1 pregnancy per 100 women per year of use). Typical failure rates are approximately 5% per year including women who do not always take the pills exactly as directed. The chance of becoming pregnant increases with each missed pill during a menstrual cycle. In comparison, typical failure rates for other methods of birth control during the first year of use are as follows: 

 Implant: <1%  
 Male sterilization: <1% 
 Injection: <1%  
 Cervical Cap with spermicides: 20 to 40% 
 IUD: 1 to 2% 
 Condom alone (male): 14% 
 Diaphragm with spermicides: 20%  
 Condom alone (female): 21% 
 Spermicides alone: 26% 
 Periodic abstinence: 25% 
 Vaginal sponge: 20 to 40% 
 Withdrawal: 19% 
 Female sterilization: <1%  
 No methods: 85% 
 WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES Do not use Pirmella if you smoke cigarettes and are over 35 years old. Smoking increases your risk of serious cardiovascular side effects (heart and blood vessel problems) from combination oral contraceptives, including death from heart attack, blood clots or stroke. This risk increases with age and the number of cigarettes you smoke. Some women should not use the pill. For example, you should not take the pill if you have any of the following conditions: A history of heart attack or stroke Blood clots in the legs (thrombophlebitis), lungs (pulmonary embolism), or eyes A history of blood clots in the deep veins of your legs An inherited problem that makes your blood clot more than normal Chest pain (angina pectoris) Known or suspected breast cancer or cancer of the lining of the uterus, cervix or vagina Unexplained vaginal bleeding (until a diagnosis is reached by your healthcare professional) Yellowing of the whites of the eyes or of the skin (jaundice) during pregnancy or during previous use of the pill Liver tumor (benign or cancerous) Known or suspected pregnancy Valvular heart disease with complications Severe hypertension Diabetes with vascular involvement Headaches with focal neurological symptoms If you plan to have surgery with prolonged bed rest Hypersensitivity to any component of this product. Tell your healthcare professional if you have ever had any of these conditions. Your healthcare professional can recommend a safer method of birth control. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS BEFORE TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES Tell your healthcare professional if you have or have had: Breast nodules, fibrocystic disease of the breast, an abnormal breast x-ray or mammogram Diabetes Elevated cholesterol or triglycerides High blood pressure Migraine or other headaches or epilepsy Mental depression Gallbladder, liver, heart or kidney disease History of scanty or irregular menstrual periods Women with any of these conditions should be checked often by their healthcare professional if they choose to use oral contraceptives. Also, be sure to inform your healthcare professional if you smoke or are on any medications. RISKS OF TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES 1. Risk of developing blood clots Blood clots and blockage of blood vessels are one of the most serious side effects of taking oral contraceptives and can cause death or serious disability. Serious blood clots can happen especially if you smoke, are obese, or are older than 35 years of age.  Serious blood clots are more likely to happen when you: First start taking birth control pills Restart the same or different birth control pills after not using them for a month or more In particular, a clot in the legs can cause thrombophlebitis and a clot that travels to the lungs can cause a sudden blocking of the vessel carrying blood to the lungs. Rarely, clots occur in the blood vessels of the eye and may cause blindness, double vision, or impaired vision. If you take oral contraceptives and need elective surgery, need to stay in bed for a prolonged illness or injury or have recently delivered a baby, you may be at risk of developing blood clots. You should consult your healthcare professional about stopping oral contraceptives three to four weeks before surgery and not taking oral contraceptives for two weeks after surgery or during bed rest. You should also not take oral contraceptives soon after delivery of a baby. It is advisable to wait for at least four weeks after delivery if you are not breastfeeding or four weeks after a second trimester abortion. If you are breastfeeding, you should wait until you have weaned your child before using the pill. (See also the section on BreastFeeding in GENERAL PRECAUTIONS). The risk of circulatory disease in oral contraceptive users may be higher in users of high-dose pills and may be greater with longer duration of oral contraceptive use. In addition, some of these increased risks may continue for a number of years after stopping oral contraceptives. The risk of abnormal blood clotting increases with age in both users and nonusers of oral contraceptives, but the increased risk from the oral contraceptive appears to be present at all ages. For women aged 20 to 44, it is estimated that about 1 in 2,000 using oral contraceptives will be hospitalized each year because of abnormal clotting. Among nonusers in the same age group, about 1 in 20,000 would be hospitalized each year. For oral contraceptive users in general, it has been estimated that in women between the ages of 15 and 34 the risk of death due to a circulatory disorder is about 1 in 12,000 per year, whereas for nonusers the rate is about 1 in 50,000 per year. In the age group 35 to 44, the risk is estimated to be about 1 in 2,500 per year for oral contraceptive users and about 1 in 10,000 per year for nonusers. 2. Heart attacks and strokes Oral contraceptives may increase the tendency to develop strokes (stoppage or rupture of blood vessels in the brain) and angina pectoris and heart attacks (blockage of blood vessels in the heart). Any of these conditions can cause death or serious disability. Smoking greatly increases the possibility of suffering heart attacks and strokes. Furthermore, smoking and the use of oral contraceptives greatly increase the chances of developing and dying of heart disease. 3. Gallbladder disease Oral contraceptive users probably have a greater risk than nonusers of having gallbladder disease, although this risk may be related to pills containing high doses of estrogens. 4. Liver tumors In rare cases, oral contraceptives can cause benign but dangerous liver tumors. These benign liver tumors can rupture and cause fatal internal bleeding. In addition, some studies report an increased risk of developing liver cancer. However, liver cancers are rare. 5. Cancer of the reproductive organs and breasts Various studies give conflicting reports on the relationship between breast cancer and oral contraceptive use. Oral contraceptive use may slightly increase your chance of having breast cancer diagnosed, particularly after using hormonal contraceptives at a younger age. After you stop using hormonal contraceptives, the chances of having breast cancer diagnosed begin to go back down. You should have regular breast examinations by a healthcare professional and examine your own breasts monthly. Tell your healthcare professional if you have a family history of breast cancer or if you have had breast nodules or an abnormal mammogram. Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use oral contraceptives because breast cancer is usually a hormone-sensitive tumor. Some studies have found an increase in the incidence of cancer of the cervix in women who use oral contraceptives. However, this finding may be related to factors other than the use of oral contraceptives. There is insufficient evidence to rule out the possibility that the pill may cause such cancers. ESTIMATED RISK OF DEATH FROM A BIRTH CONTROL METHOD OR PREGNANCY All methods of birth control and pregnancy are associated with a risk of developing certain diseases which may lead to disability or death. An estimate of the number of deaths associated with different methods of birth control and pregnancy has been calculated and is shown in the following table.

 In the above table, the risk of death from any birth control method is less than the risk of childbirth, except for oral contraceptive users over the age of 35 who smoke and pill users over the age of 40 even if they do not smoke. It can be seen in the table that for women aged 15 to 39, the risk of death was highest with pregnancy (7–26 deaths per 100,000 women, depending on age). Among pill users who do not smoke, the risk of death was always lower than that associated with pregnancy for any age group, although over the age of 40, the risk increases to 32 deaths per 100,000 women, compared to 28 associated with pregnancy at that age. However, for pill users who smoke and are over the age of 35, the estimated number of deaths exceeds those for other methods of birth control. If a woman is over the age of 40 and smokes, her estimated risk of death is four times higher (117/100,000 women) than the estimated risk associated with pregnancy (28/100,000 women) in that age group. The suggestion that women over 40 who do not smoke should not take oral contraceptives is based on information from older, higher-dose pills. An Advisory Committee of the FDA discussed this issue in 1989 and recommended that the benefits of low-dose oral contraceptive use by healthy, non-smoking women over 40 years of age may outweigh the possible risks. WARNING SIGNALS If any of these adverse effects occur while you are taking oral contraceptives, call your healthcare professional immediately: Sharp chest pain, coughing of blood, or sudden shortness of breath (indicating a possible clot in the lung) Pain in the calf (indicating a possible clot in the leg) Crushing chest pain or heaviness in the chest (indicating a possible heart attack) Sudden severe headache or vomiting, dizziness or fainting, disturbances of vision or speech, weakness, or numbness in an arm or leg (indicating a possible stroke) Sudden partial or complete loss of vision (indicating a possible clot in the eye) Breast lumps (indicating possible breast cancer or fibrocystic disease of the breast; ask your healthcare professional to show you how to examine your breasts) Severe pain or tenderness in the stomach area (indicating a possibly ruptured liver tumor) Difficulty in sleeping, weakness, lack of energy, fatigue, or change in mood (possibly indicating severe depression) Jaundice or a yellowing of the skin or eyeballs, accompanied frequently by fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, dark colored urine, or light colored bowel movements (indicating possible liver problems) SIDE EFFECTS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES 1. Vaginal bleeding Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking the pills. Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding which is a flow much like a regular period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle or lasts for more than a few days, talk to your healthcare professional. 2. Contact lenses If you wear contact lenses and notice a change in vision or an inability to wear your lenses, contact your healthcare professional. 3. Fluid retention Oral contraceptives may cause edema (fluid retention) with swelling of the fingers or ankles and may raise your blood pressure. If you experience fluid retention, contact your healthcare professional. 4. Melasma A spotty darkening of the skin is possible, particularly of the face, which may persist. 5. Other side effects Other side effects may include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, muscle cramps, change in appetite, headache, nervousness, depression, dizziness, loss of scalp hair, rash, vaginal infections, pancreatitis, skin sensitivity to the sun or ultraviolet and allergic reactions. If any of these side effects bother you, call your healthcare professional. GENERAL PRECAUTIONS 1. Missed periods and use of oral contraceptives before or during early pregnancy There may be times when you may not menstruate regularly after you have completed taking a cycle of pills. If you have taken your pills regularly and miss one menstrual period, continue taking your pills for the next cycle but be sure to inform your healthcare professional before doing so. If you have not taken the pills daily as instructed and missed a menstrual period, you may be pregnant. If you missed two consecutive menstrual periods, you may be pregnant. Check with your healthcare professional immediately to determine whether you are pregnant. Do not continue to take oral contraceptives until you are sure you are not pregnant, but continue to use another method of contraception. There is no conclusive evidence that oral contraceptive use is associated with an increase in birth defects, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Previously, a few studies had reported that oral contraceptives might be associated with birth defects, but these findings have not been seen in more recent studies. Nevertheless, oral contraceptives should not be used during pregnancy. You should check with your healthcare professional about risks to your unborn child of any medication taken during pregnancy. 2. While breastfeeding If you are breastfeeding, consult your healthcare professional before starting oral contraceptives. Some of the drug will be passed on to the child in the milk. A few adverse effects on the child have been reported, including yellowing of the skin (jaundice) and breast enlargement. In addition, combined oral contraceptives may decrease the amount and quality of your milk. If possible, do not use combined oral contraceptives while breastfeeding. You should use another method of contraception since breastfeeding provides only partial protection from becoming pregnant and this partial protection decreases significantly as you breastfeed for longer periods of time. You should consider starting combined oral contraceptives only after you have weaned your child completely. 3. Laboratory tests If you are scheduled for any laboratory tests, tell your healthcare professional you are taking birth control pills. Certain blood tests may be affected by birth control pills. 4. Drug interactions Tell your healthcare provider about all medicines and herbal products that you take. Some medicines and herbal products may make hormonal birth control less effective, including, but not limited to: certain seizure medicines (carbamazepine, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, rufinamide, and topiramate) aprepitant barbiturates bosentan colesevelam griseofulvin certain combinations of HIV medicines (nelfinavir, ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors) certain non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nevirapine) rifampin and rifabutin St. John's wort Use another birth control method (such as a condom and spermicide or diaphragm and spermicide) when you take medicines that may make Pirmella 7/7/7 and Pirmella 1/35 less effective. Some medicines and grapefruit juice may increase your level of the hormone ethinyl estradiol if used together, including: acetaminophen ascorbic acid medicines that affect how your liver breaks down other medicines (itraconazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole, and fluconazole) certain HIV medicines (atazanavir, indinavir) atorvastatin rosuvastatin etravirine Hormonal birth control methods may interact with lamotrigine, a seizure medicine used for epilepsy. This may increase the risk of seizures, so your healthcare provider may need to adjust the dose of lamotrigine. Women on thyroid replacement therapy may need increased doses of thyroid hormone. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your doctor and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. 5. Sexually transmitted diseases This product (like all oral contraceptives) is intended to prevent pregnancy. It does not protect against transmission of HIV (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and syphilis. HOW TO TAKE THE PILL 

 IMPORTANT  POINTS  TO  REMEMBER 
 BEFORE YOU START TAKING YOUR PILLS: 1. BE SURE TO READ THESE DIRECTIONS: Before you start taking your pills. Anytime you are not sure what to do. 2. THE RIGHT WAY TO TAKE THE PILL IS TO TAKE ONE PILL EVERY DAY AT THE SAME TIME. If you miss pills you could get pregnant. This includes starting the pack late. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant. 3. MANY WOMEN HAVE SPOTTING OR LIGHT BLEEDING, OR MAY FEEL SICK TO THEIR STOMACH DURING THE FIRST 1-3 PACKS OF PILLS. If you feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking the pill. The problem will usually go away. If it doesn't go away, check with your healthcare professional. 4. MISSING PILLS CAN ALSO CAUSE SPOTTING OR LIGHT BLEEDING, even when you make up these missed pills. On the days you take 2 pills to make up for missed pills, you could also feel a little sick to your stomach. 5. IF YOU HAVE VOMITING OR DIARRHEA, or IF YOU TAKE SOME MEDICINES, your pills may not work as well. Use a back-up method (such as a condom or spermicide) until you check with your healthcare professional. 6. IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE REMEMBERING TO TAKE THE PILL, talk to your healthcare professional about how to make pill taking easier or about using another method of birth control. 7. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR ARE UNSURE ABOUT THE INFORMATION IN THIS LEAFLET, call your healthcare professional. 

 BEFORE  YOU  START  TAKING  YOUR  PILLS 
 1. DECIDE WHAT TIME OF DAY YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR PILL. It is important to take it at about the same time every day. 2. LOOK AT YOUR PILL PACK.

 If you forget any of the 7 green “reminder” pills in Week 4: THROW AWAY the pills you missed. Keep taking 1 pill each day until the pack is empty. You do not need a back-up method. 
 FINALLY ,  IF  YOU  ARE  STILL  NOT  SURE  WHAT  TO  DO  ABOUT  THE  PILLS  YOU  HAVE  MISSED : 
 Use a BACK-UP METHOD anytime you have sex. 
KEEP TAKING ONE “ACTIVE” PILL EACH DAY until you can reach your healthcare professional. 
 PREGNANCY DUE TO PILL FAILURE Combined Oral Contraceptives The incidence of pill failure resulting in pregnancy is approximately one percent (i.e., one pregnancy per 100 women per year) if taken every day as directed, but more typical failure rates are 5%. If failure does occur, the risk to the fetus is minimal. PREGNANCY AFTER STOPPING THE PILL There may be some delay in becoming pregnant after you stop using oral contraceptives, especially if you had irregular menstrual cycles before you used oral contraceptives. It may be advisable to postpone conception until you begin menstruating regularly once you have stopped taking the pill and desire pregnancy. There does not appear to be any increase in birth defects in newborn babies when pregnancy occurs soon after stopping the pill. OVERDOSAGE Serious ill effects have not been reported following ingestion of large doses of oral contraceptives by young children. Overdosage may cause nausea and withdrawal bleeding in females. In case of overdosage, contact your healthcare professional or pharmacist. OTHER INFORMATION Your healthcare professional will take a medical and family history before prescribing oral contraceptives and will examine you. The physical examination may be delayed to another time if you request it and the healthcare professional believes that it is a good medical practice to postpone it. You should be reexamined at least once a year. Be sure to inform your healthcare professional if there is a family history of any of the conditions listed previously in this leaflet. Be sure to keep all appointments with your healthcare professional, because this is a time to determine if there are early signs of side effects of oral contraceptive use. Do not use the drug for any condition other than the one for which it was prescribed. This drug has been prescribed specifically for you; do not give it to others who may want birth control pills. HEALTH BENEFITS FROM ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES In addition to preventing pregnancy, use of combined oral contraceptives may provide certain benefits. They are: menstrual cycles may become more regular blood flow during menstruation may be lighter and less iron may be lost. Therefore, anemia due to iron deficiency is less likely to occur. pain or other symptoms during menstruation may be encountered less frequently ectopic (tubal) pregnancy may occur less frequently noncancerous cysts or lumps in the breast may occur less frequently acute pelvic inflammatory disease may occur less frequently oral contraceptive use may provide some protection against developing two forms of cancer: cancer of the ovaries and cancer of the lining of the uterus. If you want more information about birth control pills, ask your healthcare professional. They have a more technical leaflet called the Professional Labeling, which you may wish to read.

(4) Gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution, 0.5% is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to gatifloxacin, to other quinolones, or to any of the components in this medication [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)]. 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hypersensitivity (5.1) Growth of Resistant Organisms with Prolonged Use (5.2) Corneal Endothelial Cell Injury (5.3) 
                        5.1 Hypersensitivity
                     Some patients receiving topical ophthalmic gatifloxacin experienced hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions, angioedema (including pharyngeal, laryngeal, or facial edema), dyspnea, urticaria, and itching, even following a single dose. Rare cases of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome were reported in association with topical ophthalmic gatifloxacin use. If an allergic reaction to gatifloxacin occurs, discontinue the drug [see PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17)]. 5.2 Growth of Resistant Organisms with Prolonged Use Prolonged use of gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution, 0.5% may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. If superinfection occurs, discontinue use and institute alternative therapy. Whenever clinical judgment dictates, examine the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and where appropriate, fluorescein staining. 5.3 Corneal Endothelial Cell Injury Gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution, 0.5% is for topical ophthalmic use. Gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution, 0.5% may cause corneal endothelial cell injury if introduced directly into the anterior chamber of the eye. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) and WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.1)] Growth of Resistant Organisms With Prolonged Use [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.2)] Corneal Endothelial Cell Injury [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.3)] Most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 1 % of patients included worsening of conjunctivitis, eye irritation, dysgeusia, and eye pain. (6) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. at 1-800-399-2561 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In clinical studies of patients with bacterial conjunctivitis treated with gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution, 0.5% (N=717), the most frequently reported adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 1 % of patients were: worsening of the conjunctivitis, eye irritation, dysgeusia, and eye pain. Additional adverse reactions reported with other formulations of gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution in other clinical studies included chemosis, conjunctival hemorrhage, dry eye, eye discharge, eyelid edema, headache, increased lacrimation, keratitis, red eye, papillary conjunctivitis, and reduced visual acuity. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution, 0.5% or with other formulations of gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. These reactions included anaphylactic reactions and angioedema (including pharyngeal, oral or facial edema), blepharitis, dyspnea, eye pruritus, eye swelling (including corneal and conjunctival edema), hypersensitivity, including signs and symptoms of eye allergy and allergic dermatitis, nausea, pruritus (including pruritus generalized, rash, urticaria), and vision blurred. 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on the use of gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution, 0.5% in pregnant women to inform a drug-associated risk. Administration of oral gatifloxacin to pregnant rats and rabbits throughout organogenesis did not produce adverse development outcomes at clinically relevant doses. Administration of gatifloxacin to rats during late gestation through lactation did not produce adverse maternal, fetal or neonatal effects at clinically relevant doses. Data Animal Data: Oral administration of gatifloxacin to pregnant rats throughout organogenesis produced teratogenic effects in rat fetuses, including skeletal/craniofacial malformations, delayed ossification, atrial enlargement, and reduced fetal weight, at doses greater than or equal to 150 mg/kg/day (approximately 600-fold higher than the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose [MRHOD] for gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution, 0.5% of 0.04 mg/kg/day, on a mg/m2 basis). No teratogenic effects were observed in rat or rabbit fetuses at doses of gatifloxacin up to 50 mg/kg/day (approximately 200- and 400-fold higher than the MRHOD, respectively, on a mg/m2 basis). In a perinatal/postnatal study in rats, oral administration of gatifloxacin during late gestation through lactation produced an increase in late gestation fetal loss and neonatal/perinatal mortality at 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 800-fold higher than the MRHOD on a mg/m2 basis). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution, 0.5% in human milk, the effect of gatifloxacin on breastfed infants, or the effect of gatifloxacin on milk production. Gatifloxacin was found in the breast milk of rats following oral administration of gatifloxacin during lactation. However, systemic levels of gatifloxacin following topical ocular administration are low [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)], and it is not known whether gatifloxacin would be present in maternal milk at measurable levels following topical ocular administration. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution, 0.5% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution, 0.5%. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution, 0.5% in infants below one year of age have not been established. Gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution, 0.5% has been demonstrated in clinical trials to be safe and effective for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis in pediatric patients one year or older [see CLINICAL STUDIES (14)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety or effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients. 11 DESCRIPTION Gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution, 0.5% is a quinolone antimicrobial topical ophthalmic solution for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. Its chemical name is (±) 1-Cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-8- methoxy-7-(3-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid. Its molecular formula is C19H22FN3O4and its molecular weight is 375.40. Its chemical structure is: Gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution, 0.5% is a pale yellow colored transparent, sterile, liquid with an osmolality of 260 to 330 mOsm/kg and a pH of 5.1 to 5.7. Gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution, 0.5% contains the active ingredient gatifloxacin 0.5% (5 mg/mL) and the inactive ingredients benzalkonium chloride 0.005%, edetate disodium, sodium chloride and water for injection. Gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution, 0.5% may contain hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide to adjust pH. Gatifloxacin 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Gatifloxacin is a quinolone antimicrobial [see Microbiology (12.4)]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5% was administered to one eye of 6 healthy male subjects each in an escalated dosing regimen starting with a single 2 drop dose, then 2 drops 4 times daily for 7 days, and finally 2 drops 8 times daily for 3 days. At all time points, serum gatifloxacin levels were below the lower limit of quantification (5 ng/mL) in all subjects. 12.4 Microbiology Gatifloxacin is an 8-methoxyfluoroquinolone with a 3-methylpiperazinyl substituent at C7. The antibacterial action of gatifloxacin results from inhibition of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme that is involved in the replication, transcription, and repair of bacterial DNA. Topoisomerase IV is an enzyme known to play a key role in the partitioning of the chromosomal DNA during bacterial cell division. The mechanism of action of fluoroquinolones including gatifloxacin is different from that of aminoglycoside, macrolide, and tetracycline antibiotics. Therefore, gatifloxacin may be active against pathogens that are resistant to these antibiotics and these antibiotics may be active against pathogens that are resistant to gatifloxacin. There is no cross-resistance between gatifloxacin and the aforementioned classes of antibiotics. Cross-resistance has been observed between systemic gatifloxacin and some other fluoroquinolones. Resistance to gatifloxacin in vitro develops via multiple-step mutations. Resistance to gatifloxacin in vitro occurs at a general frequency of 1 x 10-7 to 10-10. Gatifloxacin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following organisms both microbiologically and clinically, in conjunctival infections: Aerobic gram-positive bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus epidermidis Streptococcus mitis group * Streptococcus oralis* Streptococcus pneumoniae Aerobic gram-negative bacteria: Haemophilus influenzae *Efficacy for these organisms were studied in fewer than 10 infections. 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis There was no increase in neoplasms among B6C3F1 mice given gatifloxacin in the diet for 18 months at doses averaging 81 mg/kg/day in males and 90 mg/kg/day in females. These doses are approximately 175-fold higher than the maximum recommended ophthalmic dose (MRHOD) of 0.04 mg/kg/day gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution, 0.5% in a 60 kg human (on a mg/m2 basis). A statistically significant increase in the incidence of large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia was seen in male rats treated with 100 mg/kg/day (approximately 405-fold higher than the MRHOD, on a mg/m2 basis). Fischer 344 rats have a high spontaneous background rate of LGL leukemia and the incidence in high-dose males only slightly exceeded the historical control range established for this strain. There was no increase in neoplasms among Fischer 344 rats given gatifloxacin in the diet for 2 years at doses averaging 47 mg/kg/day in males and 139 mg/kg/day in females (approximately 190- and 560-fold higher than the MRHOD, respectively), on a mg/m2 basis. Mutagenesis In genetic toxicity tests, gatifloxacin was positive in 1 of 5 strains used in bacterial reverse mutation assays: Salmonella strain TA102. Gatifloxacin was positive in in vitro mammalian cell mutation and chromosome aberration assays. Gatifloxacin was positive in in vitro unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes but not human leukocytes. Gatifloxacin was negative in in vivo micronucleus tests in mice, cytogenetics test in rats, and DNA repair test in rats. The genotoxic findings are similar to findings obtained with other quinolones and may be due to the pharmacologic inhibitory effects of high concentrations of gatifloxacin on eukaryotic type II DNA topoisomerase. Impairment of Fertility Oral administration of gatifloxacin produced no adverse effects on fertility or reproduction in rats at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 800-fold higher than the MRHOD, on a mg/m2 basis). 14 CLINICAL STUDIES In two randomized, double-masked, multicenter clinical trials, where patients 1 to 89 years of age were dosed for 5 days, gatifloxacin ophthalmic solution, 0.5% was clinically superior to its vehicle on day 6 in patients with conjunctivitis and positive conjunctival cultures. Clinical outcomes for the trials demonstrated clinical success (resolution of conjunctival hyperemia and conjunctival discharge) in 58% (193/333) of patients for the gatifloxacin-treated groups versus 45% (148/325) for the vehicle-treated groups. Microbiological outcomes for the same clinical trials demonstrated a statistically superior eradication rate for causative pathogens of 90% (301/333) for gatifloxacin vs. 70% (228/325) for vehicle. Please note that microbiological eradication does not always correlate with clinical outcome in anti-infective trials. 16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING Gatifloxacin Ophthalmic Solution, 0.5% is supplied sterile in a 5 mL white, low density polyethylene (LDPE) bottle fitted with a white low density polyethylene (LDPE) nozzle and sealed with a tan colored high density polyethylene (HDPE) cap in the following size: 2.5 mL in 5 mL bottle: NDC 68180-435-01 Storage Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15 to 30°C (59 to 86°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].

*Rosuvastatin calcium tablets can be taken with or without food, at any time of day. (2.1) 

 
*Dose range: 5 mg to 40 mg once daily. Use 40 mg dose only for patients not reaching LDL-C goal with 20 mg. (2.1) 

 
*Adult HoFH: Starting dose 20 mg/day (2.1) 

 
*Pediatric patients with HoFH: 20 mg/day for patients 7 to 17 years of age (2.2) 2.1 General Dosing Information The dose range for rosuvastatin calcium tablets in adults is 5 mg to 40 mg orally once daily. The usual starting dose is 10 mg to 20 mg once daily. The usual starting dose in adult patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is 20 mg once daily. The maximum rosuvastatin calcium tablets dose of 40 mg should be used only for those patients who have not achieved their LDL-C goal utilizing the 20 mg dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Rosuvastatin calcium tablets can be administered as a single dose at any time of day, with or without food. The tablet should be swallowed whole. When initiating rosuvastatin calcium tablets therapy or switching from another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy, the appropriate rosuvastatin calcium tablets starting dose should first be utilized, and only then titrated according to the patient’s response and individualized goal of therapy. After initiation or upon titration of rosuvastatin, lipid levels should be analyzed within 2 to 4 weeks and the dosage adjusted accordingly. 2.2 Pediatric Dosing In homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, the recommended dose is 20 mg orally once daily in patients 7 to 17 years of age. Pediatric use information for patients ages 8 to less than 10 years is approved for AstraZeneca’s CRESTOR (rosuvastatin calcium) tablets. However, due to AstraZeneca’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 2.3 Dosing in Asian Patients In Asian patients, consider initiation of rosuvastatin calcium tablets therapy with 5 mg once daily due to increased rosuvastatin plasma concentrations. The increased systemic exposure should be taken into consideration when treating Asian patients not adequately controlled at doses up to 20 mg/day [see Use in Specific Populations (8.8) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.4 Use with Concomitant Therapy Patients taking cyclosporine The dose of rosuvastatin calcium tablets should not exceed 5 mg once daily [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Patients taking gemfibrozil Avoid concomitant use of rosuvastatin calcium tablets with gemfibrozil. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, initiate rosuvastatin calcium tablets at 5 mg once daily. The dose of rosuvastatin calcium tablets should not exceed 10 mg once daily [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Patients taking atazanavir and ritonavir, lopinavir and ritonavir, or simeprevir Initiate rosuvastatin calcium tablets therapy with 5 mg once daily. The dose of rosuvastatin calcium tablets should not exceed 10 mg once daily [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Severe Renal Impairment For patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) not on hemodialysis, dosing of rosuvastatin calcium tablets should be started at 5 mg once daily and not exceed 10 mg once daily [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Rosuvastatin calcium tablets are available containing 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg or 40 mg of rosuvastatin. 5 mg tablets: Yellow, round convex shaped coated tablets with “RU5” on one side and blank on the other side. 10 mg tablets: Pink, round convex shaped coated tablets with “RU10” on one side and blank on the other side. 20 mg tablets: Pink, round convex shaped coated tablets with “RU20” on one side and blank on the other side. 40 mg tablets: Pink, oval shaped coated tablets with “RU40” on one side and blank on the other side.

 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Rosuvastatin calcium tablets are contraindicated in the following conditions: ● Patients with a known hypersensitivity to any component of this product. Hypersensitivity reactions including rash, pruritus, urticaria, and angioedema have been reported with rosuvastatin calcium tablets [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. ● Patients with active liver disease, which may include unexplained persistent elevations of hepatic transaminase levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. ●Pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3 )]. ● Lactation. Limited data indicate that rosuvastatin is present in human milk. Because statins have the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women who require rosuvastatin treatment should not breastfeed their infants [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] . 
*Known hypersensitivity to product components (4) 
 
*Active liver disease, which may include unexplained persistent elevations in hepatic transaminase levels (4) 
 
*Pregnancy (4, 8.1, 8.3) 
 
*Lactation (4, 8.2) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 
* Skeletal muscle effects (e.g., myopathy and rhabdomyolysis): Risks increase with use of 40 mg dose, advanced age (greater than or equal to 65), hypothyroidism, renal impairment, and combination use with cyclosporine, atazanavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, or simeprevir. Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported. Advise patients to promptly report to their physician unexplained and/or persistent muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness and discontinue rosuvastatin if signs or symptoms appear. (5.1, 7.5, 7.6) 

 
* Liver enzyme abnormalities: Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases can occur. Perform liver enzyme tests before initiating therapy and as clinically indicated thereafter. (5.2) 5.1 Skeletal Muscle Effects Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. These risks can occur at any dose level, but are increased at the highest dose (40 mg). Rosuvastatin should be prescribed with caution in patients with predisposing factors for myopathy (e.g., age greater than or equal to 65 years, inadequately treated hypothyroidism, renal impairment). The risk of myopathy during treatment with rosuvastatin may be increased with concurrent administration of some other lipid-lowering therapies (fibrates or niacin), gemfibrozil, cyclosporine, atazanavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, or simeprevir [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin, coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing rosuvastatin with colchicine [see Drug Interactions (7.7)]. Rosuvastatin therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated creatine kinase levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Rosuvastatin therapy should also be temporarily withheld in any patient with an acute, serious condition suggestive of myopathy or predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis (e.g., sepsis, hypotension, dehydration, major surgery, trauma, severe metabolic, endocrine, and electrolyte disorders, or uncontrolled seizures). There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by: proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation; improvement with immunosuppressive agents. All patients should be advised to promptly report to their physician unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing rosuvastatin. 5.2 Liver Enzyme Abnormalities It is recommended that liver enzyme tests be performed before the initiation of rosuvastatin, and if signs or symptoms of liver injury occur. Increases in serum transaminases [AST (SGOT) or ALT (SGPT)] have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. In most cases, the elevations were transient and resolved or improved on continued therapy or after a brief interruption in therapy. There were two cases of jaundice, for which a relationship to rosuvastatin therapy could not be determined, which resolved after discontinuation of therapy. There were no cases of liver failure or irreversible liver disease in these trials. In a pooled analysis of placebo-controlled trials, increases in serum transaminases to greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 1.1% of patients taking rosuvastatin versus 0.5% of patients treated with placebo. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including rosuvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with rosuvastatin, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a history of chronic liver disease [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Active liver disease, which may include unexplained persistent transaminase elevations, is a contraindication to the use of rosuvastatin [see Contraindications (4)]. 5.3 Concomitant Coumarin Anticoagulants Caution should be exercised when anticoagulants are given in conjunction with rosuvastatin because of its potentiation of the effect of coumarin-type anticoagulants in prolonging the prothrombin time/INR. In patients taking coumarin anticoagulants and rosuvastatin concomitantly, INR should be determined before starting rosuvastatin and frequently enough during early therapy to ensure that no significant alteration of INR occurs [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. 5.4 Proteinuria and Hematuria In the rosuvastatin clinical trial program, dipstick-positive proteinuria and microscopic hematuria were observed among rosuvastatin treated patients. These findings were more frequent in patients taking rosuvastatin 40 mg, when compared to lower doses of rosuvastatin or comparator HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, though it was generally transient and was not associated with worsening renal function. Although the clinical significance of this finding is unknown, a dose reduction should be considered for patients on rosuvastatin therapy with unexplained persistent proteinuria and/or hematuria during routine urinalysis testing. 5.5 Endocrine Effects Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin. Based on clinical trial data with rosuvastatin, in some instances these increases may exceed the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Although clinical studies have shown that rosuvastatin alone does not reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration or impair adrenal reserve, caution should be exercised if rosuvastatin is administered concomitantly with drugs that may decrease the levels or activity of endogenous steroid hormones such as ketoconazole, spironolactone, and cimetidine. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: 
*Rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria and acute renal failure and myopathy (including myositis) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] 
*Liver enzyme abnormalities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Most frequent adverse reactions (rate greater than or equal to 2%) are headache, myalgia, abdominal pain, asthenia, and nausea. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Actavis at 1-800-272-5525 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.   6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In the rosuvastatin controlled clinical trials database (placebo or active-controlled) of 5394 patients with a mean treatment duration of 15 weeks, 1.4% of patients discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation were: 
*myalgia 

 
*abdominal pain 

 
*nausea The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 2%) in the rosuvastatin controlled clinical trial database of 5394 patients were: 
*headache 

 
*myalgia 

 
*abdominal pain 

 
*asthenia 

 
*nausea Adverse reactions reported in greater than or equal to 2% of patients in placebo-controlled clinical studies and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 1. These studies had a treatment duration of up to 12 weeks.

In a clinical trial, involving 981 participants treated with rosuvastatin 40 mg (n=700) or placebo (n=281) with a mean treatment duration of 1.7 years, 5.6% of subjects treated with rosuvastatin versus 2.8% of placebo-treated subjects discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation were: myalgia, hepatic enzyme increased, headache, and nausea. Adverse reactions reported in greater than or equal to 2% of patients and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 2. Table 2.

A higher percentage of rosuvastatin-treated patients versus placebo-treated patients, 6.6% and 6.2%, respectively, discontinued study medication due to an adverse event, irrespective of treatment causality. Myalgia was the most common adverse reaction that led to treatment discontinuation. There was a significantly higher frequency of diabetes mellitus reported in patients taking rosuvastatin (2.8%) versus patients taking placebo (2.3%). Mean HbA1c was significantly increased by 0.1% in rosuvastatin-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients. The number of patients with a HbA1c >6.5% at the end of the trial was significantly higher in rosuvastatin-treated versus placebo-treated patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Pediatric use information for patients ages 8 to less than 10 years is approved for AstraZeneca’s CRESTOR (rosuvastatin calcium) tablets. However, due to AstraZeneca’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of rosuvastatin: arthralgia, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure, hepatitis, jaundice, thrombocytopenia, depression, sleep disorders (including insomnia and nightmares), peripheral neuropathy and gynecomastia. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 
* Cyclosporine: Combination increases rosuvastatin exposure. Limit rosuvastatin dose to 5 mg once daily. (2.4, 5.1,7.1, 12.3) 

 
* Gemfibrozil: Combination should be avoided. If used together, limit rosuvastatin dose to 10 mg once daily. (2.4, 5.1, 7.2) 

 
* Atazanavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, or simeprevir: Combination increases rosuvastatin exposure. Limit rosuvastatin dose to 10 mg once daily. (2.4, 5.1, 7.3, 12.3) 

 
* Coumarin anticoagulants: Combination prolongs INR. Achieve stable INR prior to starting rosuvastatin calcium tablets. Monitor INR frequently until stable upon initiation or alteration of rosuvastatin therapy. (5.3, 7.4) 

 
* Concomitant lipid-lowering therapies: Use with fibrates or lipid- modifying doses (greater than or equal to 1 g/day) of niacin increases the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects. Caution should be used when prescribing with rosuvastatin. (5.1, 7.5, 7.6) 7.1 Cyclosporine Cyclosporine increased rosuvastatin exposure (AUC) 7-fold. Therefore, in patients taking cyclosporine, the dose of rosuvastatin should not exceed 5 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.2 Gemfibrozil Gemfibrozil significantly increased rosuvastatin exposure. Due to an observed increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis, combination therapy with rosuvastatin and gemfibrozil should be avoided. If used together, the dose of rosuvastatin should not exceed 10 mg once daily [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 Protease Inhibitors Coadministration of rosuvastatin with certain protease inhibitors has differing effects on rosuvastatin exposure. Simeprevir, which is a hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor, or combinations of atazanavir/ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir, which are HIV-1 protease inhibitors, increase rosuvastatin exposure (AUC) up to threefold [see Table 4 – Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. For these protease inhibitors, the dose of rosuvastatin should not exceed 10 mg once daily. The combinations of fosamprenavir/ritonavir or tipranavir/ritonavir, which are HIV-1 protease inhibitors, produce little or no change in rosuvastatin exposure. Caution should be exercised when rosuvastatin is coadministered with protease inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Coumarin Anticoagulants Rosuvastatin significantly increased INR in patients receiving coumarin anticoagulants. Therefore, caution should be exercised when coumarin anticoagulants are given in conjunction with rosuvastatin. In patients taking coumarin anticoagulants and rosuvastatin concomitantly, INR should be determined before starting rosuvastatin and frequently enough during early therapy to ensure that no significant alteration of INR occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.5 Niacin The risk of skeletal muscle effects may be enhanced when rosuvastatin is used in combination with lipid-modifying doses (greater than or equal to 1 g/day) of niacin; caution should be used when prescribing with rosuvastatin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 7.6 Fenofibrate When rosuvastatin was coadministered with fenofibrate, no clinically significant increase in the AUC of rosuvastatin or fenofibrate was observed. Because it is known that the risk of myopathy during treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is increased with concomitant use of fenofibrates, caution should be used when prescribing fenofibrates with rosuvastatin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Colchicine Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including rosuvastatin, coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing rosuvastatin with colchicine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 
* Females of reproductive potential: Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with rosuvastatin (8.3) 
* Severe renal impairment (not on hemodialysis): Starting dose is 5 mg, not to exceed 10 mg. (2.5, 5.1, 8.6) 
* Asian population: Consider 5 mg starting dose. (2.3, 8.8) Pediatric use information for patients ages 8 to less than 10 years is approved for AstraZeneca’s CRESTOR (rosuvastatin calcium) tablets. However, due to AstraZeneca’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 

 

 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Rosuvastatin is contraindicated for use in pregnant women since safety in pregnant women has not been established and there is no apparent benefit to therapy with rosuvastatin during pregnancy. Because HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors decrease cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol, rosuvastatin may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Rosuvastatin should be discontinued as soon as pregnancy is recognized [see Contraindications (4)]. Limited published data on the use of rosuvastatin are insufficient to determine a drug-associated risk of major congenital malformations or miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental effects with oral administration of rosuvastatin during organogenesis at systemic exposures equivalent to a maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg/day in rats or rabbits (based on AUC and body surface area, respectively). In rats and rabbits, decreased pup/fetal survival occurred at 12 times and equivalent, respectively, to the MRHD of 40 mg/day [see Data]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Limited published data on rosuvastatin have not shown an increased risk of major congenital malformations or miscarriage. Rare reports of congenital anomalies have been received following intrauterine exposure to other statins. In a review of approximately 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to simvastatin or lovastatin, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deaths/stillbirths did not exceed what would be expected in the general population. The number of cases is adequate to exclude a greater than or equal to 3 to 4-fold increase in congenital anomalies over the background incidence. In 89% of the prospectively followed pregnancies, drug treatment was initiated prior to pregnancy and was discontinued at some point in the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Animal Data Rosuvastatin crosses the placenta in rats and rabbits and is found in fetal tissue and amniotic fluid at 3% and 20%, respectively, of the maternal plasma concentration following a single 25 mg/kg oral gavage dose on gestation day 16 in rats. A higher fetal tissue distribution (25% maternal plasma concentration) was observed in rabbits after a single oral gavage dose of 1 mg/kg on gestation day 18. Rosuvastatin administration did not indicate a teratogenic effect in rats at less than or equal to 25 mg/kg/day or in rabbits less than or equal to 3 mg/kg/day (doses equivalent to the MRHD of 40 mg/day based on AUC and body surface area, respectively). In female rats given 5, 15 and 50 mg/kg/day before mating and continuing through to gestation day 7 resulted in decreased fetal body weight (female pups) and delayed ossification at 50 mg/kg/day (10 times the human exposure at the MRHD dose of 40 mg/day based on AUC). In pregnant rats given 2, 10 and 50 mg/kg/day of rosuvastatin from gestation day 7 through lactation day 21 (weaning), decreased pup survival occurred at 50 mg/kg/day (dose equivalent to 12 times the MRHD of 40 mg/day based body surface area). In pregnant rabbits given 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg/day of rosuvastatin from gestation day 6 to day 18, decreased fetal viability and maternal mortality was observed at 3 mg/kg/day (dose equivalent to the MRHD of 40 mg/day based on body surface area). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary 

Rosuvastatin use is contraindicated during breastfeeding [see Contraindications (4)]. Limited data indicate that rosuvastatin is present in human milk. There is no available information on the effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects of the drug on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with rosuvastatin. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Contraception 

Rosuvastatin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with rosuvastatin. 8.4 Pediatric Use Children and adolescents 7 to 15 years of age with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia were studied in a 6-week randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study with rosuvastatin 20 mg once daily followed by 12 weeks of open-label treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.6)]. In general, the safety profile in this trial was consistent with that of the previously established safety profile in adults. Pediatric use information for patients ages 8 to less than 10 years is approved for AstraZeneca’s CRESTOR (rosuvastatin calcium) tablets. However, due to AstraZeneca’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 10,275 patients in clinical studies with rosuvastatin, 3159 (31%) were 65 years and older, and 698 (6.8%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.  Elderly patients are at higher risk of myopathy and rosuvastatin should be prescribed with caution in the elderly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Rosuvastatin exposure is not influenced by mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr greater than or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2). Exposure to rosuvastatin is increased to a clinically significant extent in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) who are not receiving hemodialysis and dose adjustment is required [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Rosuvastatin is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease, which may include unexplained persistent elevations of hepatic transaminase levels. Chronic alcohol liver disease is known to increase rosuvastatin exposure; rosuvastatin should be used with caution in these patients [see Contraindications (4), Warning and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.8 Asian Patients Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated an approximate 2-fold increase in median exposure to rosuvastatin in Asian subjects when compared with Caucasian controls. Rosuvastatin dosage should be adjusted in Asian patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 10 OVERDOSAGE There is no specific treatment in the event of overdose. In the event of overdose, the patient should be treated symptomatically and supportive measures instituted as required. Hemodialysis does not significantly enhance clearance of rosuvastatin. 11 DESCRIPTION Rosuvastatin calcium is a synthetic lipid-lowering agent for oral administration. The chemical name for rosuvastatin calcium is bis[(E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2- [methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino] pyrimidin-5-yl](3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acid] calcium salt with the following structural formula: The empirical formula for rosuvastatin calcium is (C22H27FN3O6S)2Ca and the molecular weight is 1001.14. Rosuvastatin calcium is a white amorphous powder that is sparingly soluble in water and methanol, and slightly soluble in ethanol. Rosuvastatin calcium is a hydrophilic compound with a partition coefficient (octanol/water) of 0.13 at pH of 7.0. Rosuvastatin calcium tablets for oral administration contain 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg of rosuvastatin and the following inactive ingredients: Each tablet contains: microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, sodium carbonate monohydrate, sodium dodecyl sulfate, crospovidone, magnesium stearate, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, talc, and iron oxide yellow. The 10 mg, 20 mg and 40 mg tablets also contain iron oxide red, FD&C red # 40, and FD&C blue #2. The following structural formula for rosuvastatin calcium is bis[(E)-7-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-6-isopropyl-2- [methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino] pyrimidin-5-yl](3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acid]. 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Rosuvastatin is a selective and competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme that converts 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A to mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol. In vivo studies in animals, and in vitro studies in cultured animal and human cells have shown rosuvastatin to have a high uptake into, and selectivity for, action in the liver, the target organ for cholesterol lowering. In in vivo and in vitro studies, rosuvastatin produces its lipid-modifying effects in two ways. First, it increases the number of hepatic LDL receptors on the cell-surface to enhance uptake and catabolism of LDL. Second, rosuvastatin inhibits hepatic synthesis of VLDL, which reduces the total number of VLDL and LDL particles. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In clinical pharmacology studies in man, peak plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were reached 3 to 5 hours following oral dosing. Both Cmax and AUC increased in approximate proportion to rosuvastatin dose. The absolute bioavailability of rosuvastatin is approximately 20%. Administration of rosuvastatin with food did not affect the AUC of rosuvastatin. The AUC of rosuvastatin does not differ following evening or morning drug administration. Distribution Mean volume of distribution at steady-state of rosuvastatin is approximately 134 liters. Rosuvastatin is 88% bound to plasma proteins, mostly albumin. This binding is reversible and independent of plasma concentrations. Metabolism Rosuvastatin is not extensively metabolized; approximately 10% of a radiolabeled dose is recovered as metabolite. The major metabolite is N-desmethyl rosuvastatin, which is formed principally by cytochrome P450 \ 2C9, and in vitro studies have demonstrated that N-desmethyl rosuvastatin has approximately one-sixth to one-half the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity of the parent compound. Overall, greater than 90% of active plasma HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity is accounted for by the parent compound. Excretion Following oral administration, rosuvastatin and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the feces (90%). The elimination half-life (t1/2) of rosuvastatin is approximately 19 hours. After an intravenous dose, approximately 28% of total body clearance was via the renal route, and 72% by the hepatic route. Specific Populations Race A population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics among Caucasian, Hispanic, and Black or Afro-Caribbean groups. However, pharmacokinetic studies, including one conducted in the US, have demonstrated an approximate 2-fold elevation in median exposure (AUC and Cmax) in Asian subjects when compared with a Caucasian control group. Gender There were no differences in plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin between men and women. Pediatric use information for patients ages 8 to less than 10 years is approved for AstraZeneca’s CRESTOR (rosuvastatin calcium) tablets. However, due to AstraZeneca’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Geriatric There were no differences in plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin between the nonelderly and elderly populations (age greater than or equal to 65 years). Renal Impairment Mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr greater than or equal to 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) had no influence on plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin. However, plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin increased to a clinically significant extent (about 3-fold) in patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) not receiving hemodialysis compared with healthy subjects (CLcr greater than 80 mL/min/1.73 m2). Hemodialysis Steady-state plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin in patients on chronic hemodialysis were approximately 50% greater compared with healthy volunteer subjects with normal renal function. Hepatic Impairment In patients with chronic alcohol liver disease, plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were modestly increased. In patients with Child-Pugh A disease, Cmax and AUC were increased by 60% and 5%, respectively, as compared with patients with normal liver function. In patients with Child-Pugh B disease, Cmax and AUC were increased 100% and 21%, respectively, compared with patients with normal liver function. Drug-Drug Interactions Rosuvastatin clearance is not dependent on metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4 to a clinically significant extent. Rosuvastatin is a substrate for certain transporter proteins including the hepatic uptake transporter organic anion-transporting polyprotein 1B1 (OATP1B1) and efflux transporter breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Concomitant administration of rosuvastatin with medications that are inhibitors of these transporter proteins (e.g. cyclosporine, certain HIV protease inhibitors) may result in increased rosuvastatin plasma concentrations and an increased risk of myopathy [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. It is recommended that prescribers consult the relevant product information when considering administration of such products together with rosuvastatin.

Higher plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin have been reported in very small groups of patients (n=3 to 5) who have two reduced function alleles of the gene that encodes OATP1B1 (SLCO1B1 521T greater than C). The frequency of this genotype (i.e., SLCO1B1 521 C/C) is generally lower than 5% in most racial/ethnic groups. The impact of this polymorphism on efficacy and/or safety of rosuvastatin has not been clearly established. 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 104-week carcinogenicity study in rats at dose levels of 2, 20, 60, or 80 mg/kg/day by oral gavage, the incidence of uterine stromal polyps was significantly increased in females at 80 mg/kg/day at systemic exposure 20 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on AUC. Increased incidence of polyps was not seen at lower doses. In a 107-week carcinogenicity study in mice given 10, 60, or 200 mg/kg/day by oral gavage, an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenoma/carcinoma was observed at 200 mg/kg/day at systemic exposures 20 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on AUC. An increased incidence of hepatocellular tumors was not seen at lower doses. Rosuvastatin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, the mouse lymphoma assay, and the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung cells. Rosuvastatin was negative in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 5, 15, 50 mg/kg/day, males were treated for 9 weeks prior to and throughout mating and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating and throughout mating until gestation day 7. No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 50 mg/kg/day (systemic exposures up to 10 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on AUC). In testicles of dogs treated with rosuvastatin at 30 mg/kg/day for one month, spermatidic giant cells were seen. Spermatidic giant cells were observed in monkeys after 6-month treatment at 30 mg/kg/day in addition to vacuolation of seminiferous tubular epithelium. Exposures in the dog were 20 times and in the monkey 10 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on body surface area. Similar findings have been seen with other drugs in this class. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology Central Nervous System Toxicity CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhages, edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, have been observed in dogs treated with several other members of this drug class. A chemically similar drug in this class produced dose-dependent optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in dogs, at a dose that produced plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose. Edema, hemorrhage, and partial necrosis in the interstitium of the choroid plexus was observed in a female dog sacrificed moribund at day 24 at 90 mg/kg/day by oral gavage (systemic exposures 100 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on AUC). Corneal opacity was seen in dogs treated for 52 weeks at 6 mg/kg/day by oral gavage (systemic exposures 20 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on AUC). Cataracts were seen in dogs treated for 12 weeks by oral gavage at 30 mg/kg/day (systemic exposures 60 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on AUC). Retinal dysplasia and retinal loss were seen in dogs treated for 4 weeks by oral gavage at 90 mg/kg/day (systemic exposures 100 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on AUC). Doses less than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day (systemic exposures less than or equal to 60 times the human exposure at 40 mg/day based on AUC) did not reveal retinal findings during treatment for up to one year. Juvenile Toxicology Study In a juvenile study, rats were dosed by oral gavage with 10 or 50 mg/kg/day from weaning for 9 weeks prior to pairing, throughout pairing and up to the day before necropsy for males or up to gestation day 7 for females. No effects on sexual development, testicular and epididymal appearance or fertility were observed at either dose level (2 times or up to 24 times the human exposure (AUC) at the maximum pediatric dose of 20 mg/day). 14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.3 Hypertriglyceridemia Dose-Response Study: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-response study in patients with baseline TG levels from 273 to 817 mg/dL, rosuvastatin given as a single daily dose (5 to 40 mg) over 6 weeks significantly reduced serum TG levels (Table 9).

Following dietary lead-in, patients were randomized to a sequence of treatments in conjunction with the TLC diet for 6 weeks each: rosuvastatin 10 mg followed by rosuvastatin 20 mg or rosuvastatin 20 mg followed by rosuvastatin 10 mg. Rosuvastatin reduced non HDL-C (primary end point) and circulating remnant lipoprotein levels. Results are shown in the table below.

In the overall population, the mean LDL-C reduction from baseline was 22%. About one-third of the patients benefited from increasing their dose from 20 mg to 40 mg with further LDL lowering of greater than 6%. In the 27 patients with at least a 15% reduction in LDL-C, the mean LDL-C reduction was 30% (median 28% reduction). Among 13 patients with an LDL-C reduction of less than 15%, 3 had no change or an increase in LDL-C. Reductions in LDL-C of 15% or greater were observed in 3 of 5 patients with known receptor negative status. 14.6 Pediatric Patients with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia Rosuvastatin was studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, crossover study in 14 children and adolescents with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The study included a 4-week dietary lead-in phase during which patients received rosuvastatin 10 mg daily, a cross-over phase that included two 6-week treatment periods with either rosuvastatin 20 mg or placebo in random order, followed by a 12-week open-label phase during which all patients received rosuvastatin 20 mg. Patients ranged in age from 7 to 15 years of age (median 11 years), 50% were male, 71% were Caucasian, 21% were Asian, 7% were Black, and no patients were of Hispanic ethnicity. Fifty percent were on apheresis therapy and 57% were taking ezetimibe. Patients who entered the study on apheresis therapy or ezetimibe continued the treatment throughout the entire study. Mean LDL-C at baseline was 416 mg/dL (range 152 to 716 mg/dL). A total of 13 patients completed both treatment periods of the randomized crossover phase; one patient withdrew consent due to inability to have blood drawn during the crossover phase. Rosuvastatin 20 mg significantly reduced LDL-C, total cholesterol, ApoB, and non-HDL-C compared to placebo (Table 11).

If you have any questions about rosuvastatin calcium tablets, ask your doctor. Only your doctor can determine if rosuvastatin calcium tablets is right for you. What are rosuvastatin calcium tablets? Rosuvastatin calcium tablets are a prescription medicine that contains a cholesterol-lowering medicine called rosuvastatin calcium. Most of the cholesterol in your blood is made in the liver. Rosuvastatin works by reducing cholesterol in two ways: Rosuvastatin blocks an enzyme in the liver causing the liver to make less cholesterol, and rosuvastatin increases the uptake and breakdown by the liver of cholesterol already in the blood.  
* Rosuvastatin calcium tablets are used along with diet to: 

      ○ lower the level of your “bad” cholesterol (LDL) 

       ○ increase the level of your “good” cholesterol (HDL) 

       ○ lower the level of fat in your blood (triglycerides)  
* Rosuvastatin calcium tablets are used to treat:  

      ○ adults who cannot control their cholesterol levels by diet and exercise alone 

       ○ children 7 to 17 years of age with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition that causes high levels of LDL). Pediatric use information for patients ages 8 to less than 10 years is approved for AstraZeneca’s CRESTOR (rosuvastatin calcium) tablets. However, due to AstraZeneca’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. Rosuvastatin calcium tablets are not approved for use in children with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia younger than 7 years of age. It is not known if rosuvastatin calcium tablets are safe and effective in people who have Fredrickson Type I and V dyslipidemias. Who should not take rosuvastatin calcium tablets? Do not take rosuvastatin calcium tablets if you: 
*are allergic to rosuvastatin calcium or any of the ingredients in rosuvastatin calcium tablets. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in rosuvastatin calcium tablets.

Anyone considering the use of trazodone hydrochloride tablets or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. Trazodone hydrochloride tablets are not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. WARNING: SUICIDALITY AND ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUGS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Trazodone Hydrochloride Tablets USP are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. The efficacy of Trazodone Hydrochloride Tablets USP has been established in trials with the immediate release formulation of trazodone [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Trazodone Hydrochloride Tablets USP are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (1). 
* Efficacy was established in trials of trazodone immediate release formulation in patients with major depressive disorder (14). 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The dosage should be initiated at a low-dose and increased gradually, noting the clinical response and any evidence of intolerance. Occurrence of drowsiness may require the administration of a major portion of the daily dose at bedtime or a reduction of dosage. Trazodone hydrochloride tablets should be taken shortly after a meal or light snack. Dose Selection An initial dose of 150 mg/day in divided doses is suggested. The dose may be increased by 50 mg/day every 3 to 4 days. The maximum dose for outpatients usually should not exceed 400 mg/day in divided doses. Inpatients (i.e., more severely depressed patients) may be given up to but not in excess of 600 mg/day in divided doses 
*Once an adequate response has been achieved, dosage may be gradually reduced, with subsequent adjustment depending on therapeutic response. 
*Patients should be monitored for withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing treatment with trazodone hydrochloride tablets. The dose should be gradually reduced whenever possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]. Maintenance Treatment The efficacy of trazodone hydrochloride tablets for the maintenance treatment of MDD has not been evaluated. While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long a patient treated with trazodone hydrochloride tablets should continue the drug, it is generally recommended that treatment be continued for several months after an initial response. Patients should be maintained on the lowest effective dose and be periodically reassessed to determine the continued need for maintenance treatment. Important Administration Instructions Trazodone hydrochloride tablets are scored to provide flexibility in dosing. Trazodone hydrochloride tablets can be swallowed whole or administered as a half tablet by breaking the tablet along the score line. 
* Starting dose: 150 mg in divided doses daily. May be increased by 50 mg per day every three to four days. Maximum dose: 400 mg per day in divided doses (2). 
* Trazodone hydrochloride tablets should be taken shortly after a meal or light snack (2). 
* Tablets should be swallowed whole or broken in half along the score line, and should not be chewed or crushed (2). 
* When discontinued, gradual dose reduction is recommended (2). 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Trazodone hydrochloride tablets are available in the following strengths: 50 mg- White, round, compressed tablet, debossed “PLIVA 433” on one side and scored on the other side. 100 mg- White, round, compressed tablet, debossed “PLIVA 434” on one side and scored on the other side. 150 mg- White, trapezoid, flat-face, beveled edge tablet, scored and debossed as “PLIVA” bisect “441” on one side and tri-scored and debossed as “50” in each section on the other side. Bisectable tablets of 50 mg, 100 mg and 150 mg (3). 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS None. None (4). 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 
* Clinical Worsening/Suicide Risk: Monitor for clinical worsening and suicidal thinking and behavior (5.1). 
* Serotonin Syndrome or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome-Like 

Reactions: Have been reported with antidepressants. Discontinue trazodone hydrochloride tablets and initiate supportive treatment (5.2, 7). 
* Activation of Mania/Hypomania: Screen for bipolar disorder and monitor for mania/hypomania (5.3). 
* QT Prolongation: Increases the QT interval. Avoid use with drugs that also increase the QT interval and in patients with risk factors for prolonged QT interval (5.4). 
* Use in Patients With Heart Disease: Use with caution in patients with cardiac disease (5.5). 
* Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope: Have occurred. Warn patients of risk and symptoms of hypotension (5.6). 
* Abnormal Bleeding: May increase the risk of bleeding. Use with NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation may compound this risk (5.7, 7). 
* Interaction With MAOIs: Do not use concomitantly or within 14 days of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (5.8, 7). 
* Priapism: Has occurred. Warn male patients of this risk and how/when to seek medical attention (5.9). 
* Hyponatremia: Can occur in association with SIADH (5.10). 
* Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment: Has potential to impair judgment, thinking, and motor skills. Advise patients to use caution when operating machinery (5.11). 
*Angle-Closure Glaucoma: Angle closure glaucoma has occurred in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles treated with antidepressants. (5.12) 
* Discontinuation Symptoms: May occur with abrupt discontinuation and include anxiety and sleep disturbance. Upon discontinuation, taper trazodone hydrochloride tablets and monitor for symptoms (5.13). 5.1 Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with MDD and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1,000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.

In addition to the relatively common (i.e., greater than 1%) untoward events enumerated above, the following adverse events have been reported to occur in association with the use of trazodone hydrochloride in the controlled clinical studies: akathisia, allergic reaction, anemia, chest pain, delayed urine flow, early menses, flatulence, hallucinations/delusions, hematuria, hyper-salivation, hypomania, impaired speech, impotence, increased appetite, increased libido, increased urinary frequency, missed periods, muscle twitches, numbness, and retrograde ejaculation. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Spontaneous reports regarding trazodone hydrochloride received from postmarketing experience include the following: abnormal dreams, agitation, alopecia, anxiety, aphasia, apnea, ataxia, breast enlargement or engorgement, cardiospasm, cerebrovascular accident, chills, cholestasis, clitorism, congestive heart failure, diplopia, edema, extrapyramidal symptoms, grand mal seizures, hallucinations, hemolytic anemia, hirsutism, hyperbilirubinemia, increased amylase, increased salivation, insomnia, leukocytosis, leukonychia, jaundice, lactation, liver enzyme alterations, methemoglobinemia, nausea/vomiting (most frequently), paresthesia, paranoid reaction, priapism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)], pruritus, psoriasis, psychosis, rash, stupor, inappropriate ADH syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, unexplained death, urinary incontinence, urinary retention, urticaria, vasodilation, vertigo, and weakness. Cardiovascular system effects which have been reported include the following: conduction block, orthostatic hypotension and syncope, palpitations, bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, ventricular ectopic activity, including ventricular tachycardia and QT prolongation. In postmarketing surveillance, prolonged QT interval, torsade de pointes, and ventricular tachycardia have been reported with the immediate-release form of trazodone at doses of 100 mg per day or less [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS MAOIs MAOIs should not be used within 14 days of trazodone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Trazodone may enhance the response to alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants. Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors In vitro drug metabolism studies suggest that there is a potential for drug interactions when trazodone is given with cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors. The effect of short-term administration of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily, 4 doses) on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of trazodone (50 mg) has been studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax of trazodone increased by 34%, the AUC increased 2.4 fold, the half-life increased by 2.2 fold, and the clearance decreased by 52%. Adverse effects including nausea, hypotension, and syncope were observed when ritonavir and trazodone were coadministered. It is likely that ketoconazole, indinavir, and other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole may lead to substantial increases in trazodone plasma concentrations with the potential for adverse effects. If trazodone is used with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, the risk of cardiac arrhythmia may be increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] and a lower dose of trazodone should be considered. Cytochrome P450 Inducers (e.g., Carbamazepine) Carbamazepine induces CYP3A4. Following coadministration of carbamazepine 400 mg per day with trazodone 100 mg to 300 mg daily, carbamazepine reduced plasma concentrations of trazodone and m-chlorophenlypiperazine (an active metabolite) by 76% and 60% respectively, compared to pre-carbamazepine values. Patients should be closely monitored to see if there is a need for an increased dose of trazodone when taking both drugs. Digoxin and Phenytoin Increased serum digoxin or phenytoin levels have been reported in patients receiving trazodone concurrently with either of these drugs. Monitor serum levels and adjust dosages as needed. Serotonergic Drugs Based on the mechanism of action of trazodone and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when trazodone is coadministered with other drugs that may affect the neurotransmitter systems [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. NSAIDs, Aspirin, or Other Drugs Affecting Coagulation or Bleeding Due to a possible association between serotonin modulating drugs and gastrointestinal bleeding, patients should be monitored for and cautioned about the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of trazodone and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation or bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Warfarin There have been reports of altered (either increased or decreased) prothrombin times in taking both warfarin and trazodone. 
* CNS Depressants: Trazodone may enhance effects of alcohol, barbiturates, or other CNS depressants (7). 
* CYP3A4 Inhibitors: May necessitate lower dose of trazodone hydrochloride tablets (7). 
* CYP3A4 Inducers (e.g., Carbamazepine): May necessitate higher dose of trazodone hydrochloride tablets (7). 
* Digoxin or Phenytoin: Monitor for increased serum levels (7). 
* Warfarin: Monitor for increased or decreased prothrombin time (7). 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 
* Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm (8.1). 
* Nursing Mothers: Use with caution (8.3). 
* Pediatric Patients: trazodone hydrochloride tablets are not approved in pediatric patients (8.4). 
* Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Use with caution (8.6, 8.7). 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Trazodone hydrochloride has been shown to cause increased fetal resorption and other adverse effects on the fetus in two studies using the rat when given at dose levels approximately 30 to 50 times the proposed maximum human dose. There was also an increase in congenital anomalies in one of three rabbit studies at approximately 15 to 50 times the maximum human dose. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Trazodone hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Trazodone and/or its metabolites have been found in the milk of lactating rats, suggesting that the drug may be secreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when trazodone is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Trazodone hydrochloride should not be used in children or adolescents. 8.5 Geriatric Use Reported clinical literature and experience with trazodone has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. However, as experience in the elderly with trazodone hydrochloride is limited, it should be used with caution in geriatric patients. Antidepressants have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Trazodone has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. Trazodone should be used with caution in this population. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Trazodone has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Trazodone should be used with caution in this population. 9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Trazodone hydrochloride tablets are not a controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Although trazodone hydrochloride has not been systematically studied in preclinical or clinical studies for its potential for abuse, no indication of drug-seeking behavior was seen in the clinical studies with trazodone hydrochloride. However, it is difficult to predict the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and abused. Consequently, physicians should carefully evaluate patients for a history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of misuse or abuse of trazodone hydrochloride (e.g., development of tolerance, incrementation of dose, drug-seeking behavior). 10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Human Experience Death from overdose has occurred in patients ingesting trazodone and other CNS depressant drugs concurrently (alcohol; alcohol and chloral hydrate and diazepam; amobarbital; chlordiazepoxide; or meprobamate). The most severe reactions reported to have occurred with overdose of trazodone alone have been priapism, respiratory arrest, seizures, and ECG changes, including QT prolongation. The reactions reported most frequently have been drowsiness and vomiting. Overdosage may cause an increase in incidence or severity of any of the reported adverse reactions. 10.2 Management of Overdose There is no specific antidote for trazodone hydrochloride overdose. Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any drug effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. General supportive and symptomatic measures are also recommended. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Gastric lavage with a large bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion, or in symptomatic patients. Activated charcoal should be administered. Forced diuresis may be useful in facilitating elimination of the drug. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center for additional information on the treatment of any overdose. 11 DESCRIPTION Trazodone hydrochloride, USP is an antidepressant chemically unrelated to tricyclic, tetracyclic, or other known antidepressant agents. Trazodone hydrochloride, USP is a triazolopyridine derivative designated as 2-[3-[4-(3-chlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]propyl]-1,2,4-triazolo[4, 3-a]pyridin-3(2H)-one hydrochloride. It is a white, odorless crystalline powder which is freely soluble in water. The structural formula is represented as follows: C19H22ClN5O · HCl M. W. 408.32 Each tablet, for oral administration, contains 50 mg, 100 mg or 150 mg of trazodone hydrochloride, USP. In addition, each tablet contains colloidal silicon dioxide, lactose anhydrous, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose and sodium starch glycolate. structural formula 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of trazodone’s antidepressant action is not fully understood, but is thought to be related to its potentiation of serotonergic activity in the CNS. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Preclinical studies have shown that trazodone selectively inhibits neuronal reuptake of serotonin and acts as an antagonist at 5-HT-2A/2C serotonin receptors. Trazodone is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and, unlike amphetamine-type drugs, does not stimulate the central nervous system. Trazodone antagonizes alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, a property which may be associated with postural hypotension. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In humans, trazodone hydrochloride is well absorbed after oral administration without selective localization in any tissue. When trazodone hydrochloride is taken shortly after ingestion of food, there may be an increase in the amount of drug absorbed, a decrease in maximum concentration and a lengthening in the time to maximum concentration. Peak plasma levels occur approximately one hour after dosing when trazodone hydrochloride is taken on an empty stomach or 2 hours after dosing when taken with food. Metabolism In vitro studies in human liver microsomes show that trazodone is metabolized, via oxidative cleavage, to an active metabolite, m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) by CYP3A4. Other metabolic pathways that may be involved in the metabolism of trazodone have not been well characterized. Trazodone is extensively metabolized; less than 1% of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Elimination In some patients trazodone may accumulate in the plasma. Protein Binding Trazodone is 89 to 95% protein bound in vitro at concentrations attained with therapeutic doses in humans. 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No drug- or dose-related occurrence of carcinogenesis was evident in rats receiving trazodone in daily oral doses up to 300 mg/kg for 18 months. 14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy and safety of trazodone hydrochloride was established from both inpatient and outpatient trials of the trazodone immediate release formulation in the treatment of major depressive disorder. 16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING Trazodone Hydrochloride Tablets USP are available as follows: 50 mg: White, round, compressed tablet, debossed “PLIVA 433” on one side and scored on the other side.

Image 1 Image 3 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION See FDA-approved Medication Guide 17.1 Information for Patients Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with trazodone hydrochloride and should counsel them in its appropriate use. Patients should be warned that: 
*There is a potential for increased risk of suicidal thoughts especially in children, teenagers and young adults. 
*The following symptoms should be reported to the physician: anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, hypomania and mania. 
*They should inform their physician if they have a history of bipolar disorder, cardiac disease or myocardial infarction. 
*Serotonin syndrome could occur and symptoms may include changes in mental status (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, and hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea). 
*Trazodone hydrochloride has been associated with the occurrence of priapism. 
*There is a potential for hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope. 
*There is a potential risk of bleeding (including life-threatening hemorrhages) and bleeding related events (including ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae) with the concomitant use of trazodone hydrochloride and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation or bleeding. 
*Withdrawal symptoms including anxiety, agitation and sleep disturbances, have been reported with trazodone. Clinical experience suggests that the dose should be gradually reduced. 
*Patients should be advised that taking trazodone hydrochloride tablets can cause mild pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle-closure glaucoma. Pre-existing glaucoma is almost always open-angle glaucoma because angle closure glaucoma, when diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy. Open-angle glaucoma is not a risk factor for angle-closure glaucoma. Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible to angle closure, and have a prophylactic procedure (e.g., iridectomy), if they are susceptible. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)] Patients should be counseled that: 
*Trazodone may cause somnolence or sedation and may impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks. Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles until they are reasonably certain that the drug treatment does not affect them. 
*Trazodone may enhance the response to alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants. 
*Women who intend to become pregnant or who are breastfeeding should discuss with a physician whether they should continue to use trazodone, since use in pregnant and nursing women is not recommended. Important Administration Instructions: 
*Trazodone hydrochloride tablets should be swallowed whole or broken in half along the score line. 
*Trazodone hydrochloride tablets should be taken shortly after a meal or light snack. Manufactured In Croatia By: PLIVA HRVATSKA d.o.o.

E 5/2014   MEDICATION GUIDE Trazodone Hydrochloride (traz' oh done hye'' droe klor' ide) Tablets USP Read the Medication Guide that comes with trazodone hydrochloride tablets before you start taking it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. Talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist if there is something you do not understand or you want to learn about trazodone hydrochloride tablets. What is the most important information I should know about trazodone hydrochloride tablets? Antidepressant medicines, depression or other serious mental illnesses, and suicidal thoughts or actions: Talk to your healthcare provider about: 
* All risks and benefits of treatment with antidepressant medicines 
* All treatment choices for depression or other serious mental illnesses 1. Antidepressant medicines may increase suicidal thoughts or actions in some children, teenagers, and young adults within the first few months of treatment. 2. Depression and other serious mental illnesses are the most important causes of suicidal thoughts and actions. Some people may have a higher risk of having suicidal thoughts or actions. These include people who have or have a family history of bipolar illness (also called manic-depressive illness) or suicidal thoughts or actions. 3. How can I watch for and try to prevent suicidal thoughts and actions? 
*Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is very important when an antidepressant medicine is started or when the dose is changed. 
*Call your healthcare provider right away to report new or sudden changes in mood, behavior, thoughts or feelings. 
*Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms.   Call a healthcare provider right away if you have any of the following symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: 
*Thoughts about suicide or dying 
*Attempts to commit suicide 
*New or worse depression 
*New or worse anxiety 
*Feeling very agitated or restless 
*Panic attacks 
*Trouble sleeping (insomnia) 
*New or worse irritability 
*Acting aggressive, being angry or violent 
*Acting on dangerous impulses 
*An extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) 
*Other unusual changes in behavior or mood 4. Visual problems: 
*eye pain 
*changes in vision 
*swelling or redness in or around the eye Only some people are at risk for these problems. You may want to undergo an eye examination to see if you are at risk and receive preventative treatment if you are. What else do I need to know about antidepressant medicines? Never stop an antidepressant medicine without first talking to a healthcare provider. Stopping an antidepressant medicine suddenly can cause other symptoms. Antidepressants are medicines used to treat depression and other illnesses. It is important to discuss all the risks of treating depression and also the risks of not treating it.

          1. INDICATIONS AND USAGE Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be only one component of multiple risk factor intervention in individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Drug therapy is indicated as an adjunct to diet when the response to a diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and other nonpharmacologic measures alone has been inadequate. In patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or at high risk of CHD, simvastatin tablets can be started simultaneously with diet. Simvastatin tablets are an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) indicated as an adjunctive therapy to diet to: Reduce the risk of total mortality by reducing CHD deaths and reduce the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and the need for revascularization procedures in patients at high risk of coronary events. ( 1.1) Reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, Apo B, TG and increase HDL-C in patients with primary hyperlipidemia (heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) and mixed dyslipidemia. ( 1.2) Reduce elevated TG in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and reduce TG and VLDL-C in patients with primary dysbeta-lipoproteinemia. ( 1.2) Reduce total-C and LDL-C in adult patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. ( 1.2 ) Reduce elevated total-C, LDL-C, and Apo B in boys and postmenarchal girls, 10 to 17 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia after failing an adequate trial of diet therapy. ( 1.2, 1.3) 
Limitations of Use Simvastatin tablets have not been studied in Fredrickson Types I and V dyslipidemias. ( 1.4) 1.1 Reductions in Risk of CHD Mortality and Cardiovascular Events In patients at high risk of coronary events because of existing coronary heart disease, diabetes, peripheral vessel disease, history of stroke or other cerebrovascular disease, simvastatin tablets are indicated to: Reduce the risk of total mortality by reducing CHD deaths. Reduce the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke. Reduce the need for coronary and non-coronary revascularization procedures. 1.2 Hyperlipidemia Simvastatin tablets are indicated to: Reduce elevated total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein B (Apo B), and triglycerides (TG), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with primary hyperlipidemia (Fredrickson type IIa, heterozygous familial and nonfamilial) or mixed dyslipidemia (Fredrickson type IIb). Reduce elevated TG in patients with hypertriglyceridemia (Fredrickson type lV hyperlipidemia). Reduce elevated TG and VLDL-C in patients with primary dysbetalipoproteinemia (Fredrickson type III hyperlipidemia). Reduce total-C and LDL-C in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments (e.g., LDL apheresis) or if such treatments are unavailable. 1.3 Adolescent Patients with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) Simvastatin tablets are indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce total-C, LDL-C, and Apo B levels in adolescent boys and girls who are at least one year post-menarche, 10 to 17 years of age, with HeFH, if after an adequate trial of diet therapy the following findings are present: LDL cholesterol remains ≥190 mg/dL; or LDL cholesterol remains ≥160 mg/dL and There is a positive family history of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) or Two or more other CVD risk factors are present in the adolescent patient. The minimum goal of treatment in pediatric and adolescent patients is to achieve a mean LDL-C 10 times upper limit of normal [ULN]) in patients on 80 mg/day was approximately 0.9% compared with 0.02% for patients on 20 mg/day. The incidence of rhabdomyolysis (defined as myopathy with a CK >40 times ULN) in patients on 80 mg/day was approximately 0.4% compared with 0% for patients on 20 mg/day. The incidence of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, was highest during the first year and then notably decreased during the subsequent years of treatment. In this trial, patients were carefully monitored and some interacting medicinal products were excluded. The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, is greater in patients on simvastatin 80 mg compared with other statin therapies with similar or greater LDL-C-lowering efficacy and compared with lower doses of simvastatin. Therefore, the 80-mg dose of simvastatin should be used only in patients who have been taking simvastatin 80 mg chronically (e.g., for 12 months or more) without evidence of muscle toxicity [See Dosage and Administration, Restricted Dosing for 80 mg (2.2).] If, however, a patient who is currently tolerating the 80-mg dose of simvastatin needs to be initiated on an interacting drug that is contraindicated or is associated with a dose cap for simvastatin, that patient should be switched to an alternative statin with less potential for the drug-drug interaction. Patients should be advised of the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, and to report promptly any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness. If symptoms occur, treatment should be discontinued immediately. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2).] There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), an autoimmune myopathy, associated with statin use. IMNM is characterized by: proximal muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase, which persist despite discontinuation of statin treatment; muscle biopsy showing necrotizing myopathy without significant inflammation; improvement with immunosuppressive agents. All patients starting therapy with simvastatin, or whose dose of simvastatin is being increased, should be advised of the risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, and told to report promptly any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness or weakness particularly if accompanied by malaise or fever or if muscle signs and symptoms persist after discontinuing simvastatin. Simvastatin therapy should be discontinued immediately if myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. In most cases, muscle symptoms and CK increases resolved when treatment was promptly discontinued. Periodic CK determinations may be considered in patients starting therapy with simvastatin or whose dose is being increased, but there is no assurance that such monitoring will prevent myopathy. Many of the patients who have developed rhabdomyolysis on therapy with simvastatin have had complicated medical histories, including renal insufficiency usually as a consequence of long-standing diabetes mellitus. Such patients merit closer monitoring. Simvastatin therapy should be discontinued if markedly elevated CPK levels occur or myopathy is diagnosed or suspected. Simvastatin therapy should also be temporarily withheld in any patient experiencing an acute or serious condition predisposing to the development of renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis, e.g., sepsis; hypotension; major surgery; trauma; severe metabolic, endocrine, or electrolyte disorders; or uncontrolled epilepsy. Drug Interactions The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased by high levels of statin activity in plasma. Simvastatin is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 isoform 3A4. Certain drugs which inhibit this metabolic pathway can raise the plasma levels of simvastatin and may increase the risk of myopathy. These include itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, the macrolide antibiotics erythromycin and clarithromycin, and the ketolide antibiotic telithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, boceprevir, telaprevir, the antidepressant nefazodone, cobicistat-containing products, or grapefruit juice [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).] . Combination of these drugs with simvastatin is contraindicated. If short-term treatment with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is unavoidable, therapy with simvastatin must be suspended during the course of treatment. [See Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1).] The combined use of simvastatin with gemfibrozil, cyclosporine, or danazol is contraindicated [See Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7.1 and 7.2).] Caution should be used when prescribing other fibrates with simvastatin, as these agents can cause myopathy when given alone and the risk is increased when they are coadministered [see Drug Interactions (7.2).] Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with simvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing simvastatin with colchicine [see Drug Interactions (7.7).] The benefits of the combined use of simvastatin with the following drugs should be carefully weighed against the potential risks of combinations: other lipid-lowering drugs (other fibrates, ≥1 g/day of niacin, or, for patients with HoFH, lomitapide), amiodarone, dronedarone, verapamil, diltiazem, amlodipine, or ranolazine [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Table 3 in Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] [also see Dosage and Administration, Patients with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (2.4)] Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been observed with simvastatin coadministered with lipid-modifying doses (≥1 g/day niacin) of niacin-containing products. In an ongoing, double-blind, randomized cardiovascular outcomes trial, an independent safety monitoring committee identified that the incidence of myopathy is higher in Chinese compared with non-Chinese patients taking simvastatin 40 mg coadministered with lipid-modifying doses of a niacin-containing product. Caution should be used when treating Chinese patients with simvastatin in doses exceeding 20 mg/day coadministered with lipid- modifying doses of niacin-containing products. Because the risk for myopathy is dose-related, Chinese patients should not receive simvastatin 80 mg coadministered with lipid-modifying doses of niacin- containing products. It is unknown if the risk for myopathy with coadministration of simvastatin with lipid-modifying doses of niacin-containing products observed in Chinese patients applies to other Asian patients [see Drug Interactions (7.4)] . Prescribing recommendations for interacting agents are summarized in Table 1 [see also Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4) Drug Interactions (7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 



 Table 1: Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors, e.g.: Itraconazole Ketoconazole Posaconazole Voriconazole Erythromycin Clarithromycin Telithromycin HIV protease inhibitors Boceprevir Telaprevir Nefazodone Cobicistat-containing products Gemfibrozil Cyclosporine Danazol Contraindicated with simvastatin Verapamil Diltiazem Dronedarone Do not exceed 10 mg simvastatin daily Amiodarone Amlodipine Ranolazine Do not exceed 20 mg simvastatin daily Lomitapide For patients with HoFH, do not exceed 20 mg simvastatin daily For patients with HoFH who have been taking 80 mg simvastatin chronically (e.g., for 12 months or more) without evidence of muscle toxicity, do not exceed 40 mg simvastatin when taking lomitapide. Grapefruit juice Avoid grapefruit juice 5.2 Liver Dysfunction Persistent increases (to more than 3X the ULN) in serum transaminases have occurred in approximately 1% of patients who received simvastatin in clinical studies. When drug treatment was interrupted or discontinued in these patients, the transaminase levels usually fell slowly to pretreatment levels. The increases were not associated with jaundice or other clinical signs or symptoms. There was no evidence of hypersensitivity. In the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] , the number of patients with more than one transaminase elevation to > 3X ULN, over the course of the study, was not significantly different between the simvastatin and placebo groups (14 [0.7%] vs. 12 [0.6%]). Elevated transaminases resulted in the discontinuation of 8 patients from therapy in the simvastatin group (n=2,221) and 5 in the placebo group (n=2,223). Of the 1,986 simvastatin treated patients in 4S with normal liver function tests (LFTs) at baseline, 8 (0.4%) developed consecutive LFT elevations to > 3X ULN and/or were discontinued due to transaminase elevations during the 5.4 years (median follow-up) of the study. Among these 8 patients, 5 initially developed these abnormalities within the first year. All of the patients in this study received a starting dose of 20 mg of simvastatin; 37% were titrated to 40 mg. In 2 controlled clinical studies in 1,105 patients, the 12-month incidence of persistent hepatic transaminase elevation without regard to drug relationship was 0.9% and 2.1% at the 40- and 80-mg dose, respectively. No patients developed persistent liver function abnormalities following the initial 6 months of treatment at a given dose. It is recommended that liver function tests be performed before the initiation of treatment, and thereafter when clinically indicated. There have been rare postmarketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including simvastatin. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with simvastatin, promptly interrupt therapy. If an alternate etiology is not found do not restart simvastatin. Note that ALT may emanate from muscle, therefore ALT rising with CK may indicate myopathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . The drug should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver diseases or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of simvastatin. Moderate (less than 3X ULN) elevations of serum transaminases have been reported following therapy with simvastatin. These changes appeared soon after initiation of therapy with simvastatin, were often transient, were not accompanied by any symptoms and did not require interruption of treatment. 5.3 Endocrine Function Increases in HbA1c and fasting serum glucose levels have been reported with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including simvastatin. 6. ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5.0%) are: upper respiratory infection, headache, abdominal pain, constipation, and nausea. ( 6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Accord Healthcare Inc. at 1-866-941-7875 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In the pre-marketing controlled clinical studies and their open extensions (2,423 patients with median duration of follow-up of approximately 18 months), 1.4% of patients were discontinued due to adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions that led to treatment discontinuation were: gastrointestinal disorders (0.5%), myalgia (0.1%), and arthralgia (0.1%). The most commonly reported adverse reactions (incidence ≥5%) in simvastatin controlled clinical trials were: upper respiratory infections (9.0%), headache (7.4%), abdominal pain (7.3%), constipation (6.6%), and nausea (5.4%). Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study In 4S involving 4,444 (age range 35 to 71 years, 19% women, 100% Caucasians) treated with 20 to 40 mg/day of simvastatin (n=2,221) or placebo (n=2,223) over a median of 5.4 years, adverse reactions reported in ≥2% of patients and at a rate greater than placebo are shown in Table 2.

3.1 Heart Protection Study In the Heart Protection Study (HPS), involving 20,536 patients (age range 40 to 80 years, 25% women, 97% Caucasians, 3% other races) treated with simvastatin tablets 40 mg/day (n=10,269) or placebo (n=10,267) over a mean of 5 years, only serious adverse reactions and discontinuations due to any adverse reactions were recorded. Discontinuation rates due to adverse reactions were 4.8% in patients treated with simvastatin tablets compared with 5.1% in patients treated with placebo. The incidence of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis was 10 times upper limit of normal [ULN]) in patients on 80 mg/day was approximately 0.9% compared with 0.02% for patients on 20 mg/day. The incidence of rhabdomyolysis (defined as myopathy with a CK >40 times ULN) in patients on 80 mg/day was approximately 0.4% compared with 0% for patients on 20 mg/day. The incidence of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, was highest during the first year and then notably decreased during the subsequent years of treatment. In this trial, patients were carefully monitored and some interacting medicinal products were excluded. Other adverse reactions reported in clinical trials were: diarrhea, rash, dyspepsia, flatulence, and asthenia. Laboratory Tests Marked persistent increases of hepatic transaminases have been noted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Elevated alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase have also been reported. About 5% of patients had elevations of CK levels of 3 or more times the normal value on one or more occasions. This was attributable to the noncardiac fraction of CK. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1).] Adolescent Patients (ages 10 to 17 years) In a 48-week, controlled study in adolescent boys and girls who were at least 1 year post-menarche, 10 to 17 years of age (43.4% female, 97.7% Caucasians, 1.7% Hispanics, 0.6% Multiracial) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (n=175), treated with placebo or simvastatin tablets (10 to 40 mg daily), the most common adverse reactions observed in both groups were upper respiratory infection, headache, abdominal pain, and nausea [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2)] . 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because the below reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of simvastatin: pruritus, alopecia, a variety of skin changes (e.g., nodules, discoloration, dryness of skin/mucous membranes, changes to hair/nails), dizziness, muscle cramps, myalgia, pancreatitis, paresthesia, peripheral neuropathy, vomiting, anemia, erectile dysfunction, interstitial lung disease, rhabdomyolysis, hepatitis/jaundice, fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure, and depression. There have been rare reports of immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy associated with statin use [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] An apparent hypersensitivity syndrome has been reported rarely which has included some of the following features: anaphylaxis, angioedema, lupus erythematous-like syndrome, polymyalgia rheumatica, dermatomyositis, vasculitis, purpura, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hemolytic anemia, positive ANA, ESR increase, eosinophilia, arthritis, arthralgia, urticaria, asthenia, photosensitivity, fever, chills, flushing, malaise, dyspnea, toxic epidermal necrolysis, erythema multiforme, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. There have been rare postmarketing reports of cognitive impairment (e.g., memory loss, forgetfulness, amnesia, memory impairment, confusion) associated with statin use. These cognitive issues have been reported for all statins. The reports are generally nonserious, and reversible upon statin discontinuation, with variable times to symptom onset (1 day to years) and symptom resolution (median of 3 weeks). 7. DRUG INTERACTIONS 



 Drug Interactions Associated with Increased Risk of  Myopathy/Rhabdomyolysis ( 2.3, 2.4, 4, 5.1, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 12.3) Interacting Agents Prescribing Recommendations Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, telithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, boceprevir, telaprevir, nefazodone cobicistat-containing products), gemfibrozil, cyclosporine, danazol Contraindicated with simvastatin Verapamil, diltiazem, dronedarone Do not exceed 10 mg simvastatin daily Amiodarone, amlodipine, ranolazine Do not exceed 20 mg simvastatin daily Lomitapide For patients with HoFH, do not exceed 20 mg simvastatin daily For patients with HoFH who have been taking 80 mg simvastatin chronically (e.g., for 12 months or more) without evidence of muscle toxicity, do not exceed 40 mg simvastatin when taking lomitapide. Grapefruit juice Avoid grapefruit juice Other Lipid-lowering Medications: Use with other fibrate products or lipid-modifying doses (≥1 g/day) of niacin increases the risk of adverse skeletal muscle effects. Caution should be used when prescribing with simvastatin. ( 5.1, 7.2, 7.4) Coumarin anticoagulants: Concomitant use with simvastatin tablets prolongs INR. Achieve stable INR prior to starting simvastatin tablets. Monitor INR frequently until stable upon initiation or alteration of simvastatin tablets therapy. ( 7.6) 7.1 Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors, Cyclosporine, or Danazol Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: Simvastatin, like several other inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, is a substrate of CYP3A4. Simvastatin is metabolized by CYP3A4 but has no CYP3A4 inhibitory activity; therefore it is not expected to affect the plasma concentrations of other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. Elevated plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity increases the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, particularly with higher doses of simvastatin. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).] Concomitant use of drugs labeled as having a strong inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)] . If treatment with itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin or telithromycin is unavoidable, therapy with simvastatin must be suspended during the course of treatment. Cyclosporine or Danazol: The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant administration of cyclosporine or danazol. Therefore, concomitant use of these drugs is contraindicated. [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.2 Lipid-Lowering Drugs That Can Cause Myopathy When Given Alone Gemfibrozil: Contraindicated with simvastatin [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Other fibrates: Caution should be used when prescribing with simvastatin [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . 7.3 Amiodarone, Dronedarone, Ranolazine, or Calcium Channel Blockers The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, is increased by concomitant administration of amiodarone, dronedarone, ranolazine, or calcium channel blockers such as verapamil, diltiazem, or amlodipine [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Table 3 in Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.4 Niacin Cases of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis have been observed with simvastatin coadministered with lipid-modifying doses (≥ 1 g/day niacin) of niacin-containing products. In particular, caution should be used when treating Chinese patients with simvastatin doses exceeding 20 mg/day coadministered with lipid-modifying doses of niacin-containing products. Because the risk for myopathy is dose-related, Chinese patients should not receive simvastatin 80 mg coadministered with lipid-modifying doses of niacin-containing products. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.5 Digoxin In one study, concomitant administration of digoxin with simvastatin resulted in a slight elevation in digoxin concentrations in plasma. Patients taking digoxin should be monitored appropriately when simvastatin is initiated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 7.6 Coumarin Anticoagulants In two clinical studies, one in normal volunteers and the other in hypercholesterolemic patients, simvastatin 20 to 40 mg/day modestly potentiated the effect of coumarin anticoagulants: the prothrombin time, reported as International Normalized Ratio (INR), increased from a baseline of 1.7 to 1.8 and from 2.6 to 3.4 in the volunteer and patient studies, respectively. With other statins, clinically evident bleeding and/or increased prothrombin time has been reported in a few patients taking coumarin anticoagulants concomitantly. In such patients, prothrombin time should be determined before starting simvastatin and frequently enough during early therapy to ensure that no significant alteration of prothrombin time occurs. Once a stable prothrombin time has been documented, prothrombin times can be monitored at the intervals usually recommended for patients on coumarin anticoagulants. If the dose of simvastatin is changed or discontinued, the same procedure should be repeated. Simvastatin therapy has not been associated with bleeding or with changes in prothrombin time in patients not taking anticoagulants. 7.7 Colchicine Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with simvastatin coadministered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing simvastatin with colchicine. 8. USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Severe renal impairment: patients should be started at 5 mg/day and be closely monitored. ( 2.6, 8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category X [See Contraindications (4).] Simvastatin tablets are contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. Lipid lowering drugs offer no benefit during pregnancy, because cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives are needed for normal fetal development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic process, and discontinuation of lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy should have little impact on long-term outcomes of primary hypercholesterolemia therapy. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of use with simvastatin tablets during pregnancy; however, there are rare reports of congenital anomalies in infants exposed to statins in utero. Animal reproduction studies of simvastatin in rats and rabbits showed no evidence of teratogenicity. Serum cholesterol and triglycerides increase during normal pregnancy, and cholesterol or cholesterol derivatives are essential for fetal development. Because statins decrease cholesterol synthesis and possibly the synthesis of other biologically active substances derived from cholesterol, simvastatin tablets may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. If simvastatin tablets are used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. There are rare reports of congenital anomalies following intrauterine exposure to statins. In a review Manson, J.M., Freyssinges, C., Ducrocq, M.B., Stephenson, W.P., Postmarketing Surveillance of Lovastatin and Simvastatin Exposure During Pregnancy, Reproductive Toxicology,, 10(6):439-446, 1996. of approximately 100 prospectively followed pregnancies in women exposed to simvastatin or another structurally related statin, the incidences of congenital anomalies, spontaneous abortions, and fetal deaths/stillbirths did not exceed those expected in the general population. However, the study was only able to exclude a 3- to 4-fold increased risk of congenital anomalies over the background rate. In 89% of these cases, drug treatment was initiated prior to pregnancy and was discontinued during the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Simvastatin was not teratogenic in rats or rabbits at doses (25, 10 mg/kg/day, respectively) that resulted in 3 times the human exposure based on mg/m 2 surface area. However, in studies with another structurally-related statin, skeletal malformations were observed in rats and mice. Women of childbearing potential, who require treatment with simvastatin tablets for a lipid disorder, should be advised to use effective contraception. For women trying to conceive, discontinuation of simvastatin tablets should be considered. If pregnancy occurs, simvastatin tablets should be immediately discontinued. 8.3 Nursing Mothers It is not known whether simvastatin is excreted in human milk. Because a small amount of another drug in this class is excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women taking simvastatin should not nurse their infants. A decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother [see Contraindications (4)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of simvastatin in patients 10 to 17 years of age with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial in adolescent boys and in girls who were at least 1 year post-menarche. Patients treated with simvastatin had an adverse reaction profile similar to that of patients treated with placebo. Doses greater than 40 mg have not been studied in this population. In this limited controlled study, there was no significant effect on growth or sexual maturation in the adolescent boys or girls, or on menstrual cycle length in girls. [See Dosage and Administration (2.5), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14.2).] Adolescent females should be counseled on appropriate contraceptive methods while on simvastatin therapy [see Contraindications (4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Simvastatin has not been studied in patients younger than 10 years of age, nor in pre-menarchal girls. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 2,423 patients who received simvastatin tablets in Phase III clinical studies and the 10,269 patients in the Heart Protection Study who received simvastatin tablets, 363 (15%) and 5,366 (52%), respectively were ≥65 years old. In HPS, 615 (6%) were ≥75 years old. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Since advanced age (≥65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, simvastatin tablets should be prescribed with caution in the elderly. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).] A pharmacokinetic study with simvastatin showed the mean plasma level of statin activity to be approximately 45% higher in elderly patients between 70 to 78 years of age compared with patients between 18 to 30 years of age. In 4S, 1,021 (23%) of 4,444 patients were 65 or older. Lipid-lowering efficacy was at least as great in elderly patients compared with younger patients, and simvastatin tablets significantly reduced total mortality and CHD mortality in elderly patients with a history of CHD. In HPS, 52% of patients were elderly (4,891 patients 65 to 69 years and 5,806 patients 70 years or older). The relative risk reductions of CHD death, non-fatal MI, coronary and non-coronary revascularization procedures, and stroke were similar in older and younger patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. In HPS, among 32,145 patients entering the active run-in period, there were 2 cases of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis; these patients were aged 67 and 73. Of the 7 cases of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis among 10,269 patients allocated to simvastatin, 4 were aged 65 or more (at baseline), of whom one was over 75. There were no overall differences in safety between older and younger patients in either 4S or HPS. Because advanced age (≥65 years) is a predisposing factor for myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, simvastatin tablets should be prescribed with caution in the elderly. In a clinical trial of patients treated with simvastatin 80 mg/day, patients ≥65 years of age had an increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, compared to patients 10 mg simvastatin, based on clinical and/or postmarketing experience [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Verapamil SR 240 mg QD Days 1 to 7 then 240 mg BID on Days 8 to 10 80 mg on Day 10 simvastatin acid

↓ from 7.0 to 4.7 ng·eq/mL In a study of 12 healthy volunteers, simvastatin at the 80-mg dose had no effect on the metabolism of the probe cytochrome P450 isoform 3A4 (CYP3A4) substrates midazolam and erythromycin. This indicates that simvastatin is not an inhibitor of CYP3A4, and, therefore, is not expected to affect the plasma levels of other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration of simvastatin(40 mg QD for 10 days) resulted in an increase in the maximum mean levels of cardioactive digoxin (given as a single 0.4 mg dose on day 10) by approximately 0.3 ng/mL. 13. NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 72-week carcinogenicity study, mice were administered daily doses of simvastatin of 25, 100, and 400 mg/kg body weight, which resulted in mean plasma drug levels approximately 1, 4, and 8 times higher than the mean human plasma drug level, respectively (as total inhibitory activity based on AUC) after an 80-mg oral dose. Liver carcinomas were significantly increased in high-dose females and mid- and high-dose males with a maximum incidence of 90% in males. The incidence of adenomas of the liver was significantly increased in mid- and high-dose females. Drug treatment also significantly increased the incidence of lung adenomas in mid- and high-dose males and females. Adenomas of the Harderian gland (a gland of the eye of rodents) were significantly higher in high-dose mice than in controls. No evidence of a tumorigenic effect was observed at 25 mg/kg/day. In a separate 92-week carcinogenicity study in mice at doses up to 25 mg/kg/day, no evidence of a tumorigenic effect was observed (mean plasma drug levels were 1 times higher than humans given 80 mg simvastatin as measured by AUC). In a two-year study in rats at 25 mg/kg/day, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of thyroid follicular adenomas in female rats exposed to approximately 11 times higher levels of simvastatin than in humans given 80 mg simvastatin (as measured by AUC). A second two-year rat carcinogenicity study with doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg/day produced hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas (in female rats at both doses and in males at 100 mg/kg/day). Thyroid follicular cell adenomas were increased in males and females at both doses; thyroid follicular cell carcinomas were increased in females at 100 mg/kg/day. The increased incidence of thyroid neoplasms appears to be consistent with findings from other statins. These treatment levels represented plasma drug levels (AUC) of approximately 7 and 15 times (males) and 22 and 25 times (females) the mean human plasma drug exposure after an 80 milligram daily dose. No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in a microbial mutagenicity (Ames) test with or without rat or mouse liver metabolic activation. In addition, no evidence of damage to genetic material was noted in an in vitro alkaline elution assay using rat hepatocytes, a V-79 mammalian cell forward mutation study, an in vitro chromosome aberration study in CHO cells, or an in vivo chromosomal aberration assay in mouse bone marrow. There was decreased fertility in male rats treated with simvastatin for 34 weeks at 25 mg/kg body weight (4 times the maximum human exposure level, based on AUC, in patients receiving 80 mg/day); however, this effect was not observed during a subsequent fertility study in which simvastatin was administered at this same dose level to male rats for 11 weeks (the entire cycle of spermatogenesis including epididymal maturation). No microscopic changes were observed in the testes of rats from either study. At 180 mg/kg/day, (which produces exposure levels 22 times higher than those in humans taking 80 mg/day based on surface area, mg/m 2), seminiferous tubule degeneration (necrosis and loss of spermatogenic epithelium) was observed. In dogs, there was drug-related testicular atrophy, decreased spermatogenesis, spermatocytic degeneration and giant cell formation at 10 mg/kg/day, (approximately 2 times the human exposure, based on AUC, at 80 mg/day). The clinical significance of these findings is unclear. 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology CNS Toxicity Optic nerve degeneration was seen in clinically normal dogs treated with simvastatin for 14 weeks at 180 mg/kg/day, a dose that produced mean plasma drug levels about 12 times higher than the mean plasma drug level in humans taking 80 mg/day. A chemically similar drug in this class also produced optic nerve degeneration (Wallerian degeneration of retinogeniculate fibers) in clinically normal dogs in a dose-dependent fashion starting at 60 mg/kg/day, a dose that produced mean plasma drug levels about 30 times higher than the mean plasma drug level in humans taking the highest recommended dose (as measured by total enzyme inhibitory activity). This same drug also produced vestibulocochlear Wallerian-like degeneration and retinal ganglion cell chromatolysis in dogs treated for 14 weeks at 180 mg/kg/day, a dose that resulted in a mean plasma drug level similar to that seen with the 60 mg/kg/day dose. CNS vascular lesions, characterized by perivascular hemorrhage and edema, mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular spaces, perivascular fibrin deposits and necrosis of small vessels were seen in dogs treated with simvastatin at a dose of 360 mg/kg/day, a dose that produced mean plasma drug levels that were about 14 times higher than the mean plasma drug levels in humans taking 80 mg/day. Similar CNS vascular lesions have been observed with several other drugs of this class. There were cataracts in female rats after two years of treatment with 50 and 100 mg/kg/day (22 and 25 times the human AUC at 80 mg/day, respectively) and in dogs after three months at 90 mg/kg/day (19 times) and at two years at 50 mg/kg/day (5 times). 14. CLINICAL STUDIES  14.1 Clinical Studies in Adults Reductions in Risk of CHD Mortality and Cardiovascular Events In 4S, the effect of therapy with simvastatin tablets on total mortality was assessed in 4,444 patients with CHD and baseline total cholesterol 212 to 309 mg/dL (5.5 to 8.0 mmol/L). In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients were treated with standard care, including diet, and either simvastatin tablets 20 to 40 mg/day (n=2,221) or placebo (n=2,223) for a median duration of 5.4 years. Over the course of the study, treatment with simvastatin tablets led to mean reductions in total-C, LDL-C and TG of 25%, 35%, and 10%, respectively, and a mean increase in HDL-C of 8%. Simvastatin tablets significantly reduced the risk of mortality by 30% (p=0.0003, 182 deaths in the simvastatin tablets group vs 256 deaths in the placebo group). The risk of CHD mortality was significantly reduced by 42% (p=0.00001, 111 vs 189 deaths). There was no statistically significant difference between groups in non-cardiovascular mortality. Simvastatin tablets significantly decreased the risk of having major coronary events (CHD mortality plus hospital-verified and silent non-fatal myocardial infarction [MI]) by 34% (p   Angiographic Studies 
 In the Multicenter Anti-Atheroma Study, the effect of simvastatin on atherosclerosis was assessed by quantitative coronary angiography in hypercholesterolemic patients with CHD. In this randomized, double-blind, controlled study, patients were treated with simvastatin 20 mg/day or placebo. Angiograms were evaluated at baseline, two and four years. The co-primary study endpoints were mean change per-patient in minimum and mean lumen diameters, indicating focal and diffuse disease, respectively. Simvastatin tablets significantly slowed the progression of lesions as measured in the Year 4 angiogram by both parameters, as well as by change in percent diameter stenosis. In addition, simvastatin significantly decreased the proportion of patients with new lesions and with new total occlusions.
  Modifications of Lipid Profiles 
  Primary Hyperlipidemia (Fredrickson type lla and llb) 
 Simvastatin tablets have been shown to be effective in reducing total-C and LDL-C in heterozygous familial and non-familial forms of hyperlipidemia and in mixed hyperlipidemia. Maximal to near maximal response is generally achieved within 4 to 6 weeks and maintained during chronic therapy. Simvastatin tablets significantly decreased total-C, LDL-C, total-C/HDL-C ratio, and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio; simvastatin tablets also decreased TG and increased HDL-C ( see Table 5).

      Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia 
 In a controlled clinical study, 12 patients 15 to 39 years of age with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia received simvastatin 40 mg/day in a single dose or in 3 divided doses, or 80 mg/day in 3 divided doses. In 11 patients with reductions in LDL-C, the mean LDL-C changes for the 40- and 80-mg doses were 14% (range 8% to 23%, median 12%) and 30% (range 14% to 46%, median 29%), respectively. One patient had an increase of 15% in LDL-C. Another patient with absent LDL-C receptor function had an LDL-C reduction of 41% with the 80-mg dose.
  Endocrine Function 
 In clinical studies, simvastatin did not impair adrenal reserve or significantly reduce basal plasma cortisol concentration. Small reductions from baseline in basal plasma testosterone in men were observed in clinical studies with simvastatin, an effect also observed with other statins and the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine. There was no effect on plasma gonadotropin levels. In a placebo-controlled, 12-week study there was no significant effect of simvastatin 80 mg on the plasma testosterone response to human chorionic gonadotropin. In another 24-week study, simvastatin 20 to 40 mg had no detectable effect on spermatogenesis. In 4S, in which 4,444 patients were randomized to simvastatin 20 to 40 mg/day or placebo for a median duration of 5.4 years, the incidence of male sexual adverse events in the two treatment groups was not significantly different. Because of these factors, the small changes in plasma testosterone are unlikely to be clinically significant. The effects, if any, on the pituitary-gonadal axis in pre-menopausal women are unknown.
     Simvastatin            14.2 Clinical Studies in Adolescents In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 175 patients (99 adolescent boys and 76 post-menarchal girls) 10 to 17 years of age (mean age 14.1 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) were randomized to simvastatin (n=106) or placebo (n=67) for 24 weeks (base study). Inclusion in the study required a baseline LDL-C level between 160 and 400 mg/dL and at least one parent with an LDL-C level >189 mg/dL. The dosage of simvastatin (once daily in the evening) was 10 mg for the first 8 weeks, 20 mg for the second 8 weeks, and 40 mg thereafter. In a 24-week extension, 144 patients elected to continue therapy with simvastatin 40 mg or placebo. Simvastatin tablets significantly decreased plasma levels of total-C, LDL-C, and Apo B (see Table 8). Results from the extension at 48 weeks were comparable to those observed in the base study.

Anaphylactic reactions to Oxaliplatin have been reported, and may occur within minutes of Oxaliplatin administration. Epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines have been employed to alleviate symptoms. ( 5.1 ) 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Oxaliplatin, used in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, is indicated for: 
*adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer in patients who have undergone complete resection of the primary tumor. 
*treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based drug used in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil /leucovorin, which is indicated for: 
*adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer in patients who have undergone complete resection of the primary tumor. (1) 
*treatment of advanced colorectal cancer. (1) 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Oxaliplatin should be administered under the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Appropriate management of therapy and complications is possible only when adequate diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available. 
*Administer Oxaliplatin in combination with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin every 2 weeks. (2.1): - Day 1: Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 intravenous infusion in 250-500 mL 5% Dextrose Injection, USP and leucovorin 200 mg/m2 intravenous infusion in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP both given over 120 minutes at the same time in separate bags using a Y-line, followed by 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 intravenous bolus given over 2 to 4 minutes, followed by 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 intravenous infusion in 500 mL 5% Dextrose Injection, USP (recommended) as a 22-hour continuous infusion. - Day 2: Leucovorin 200 mg/m2 intravenous infusion over 120 minutes followed by 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 intravenous bolus given over 2 to 4 minutes followed by 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 intravenous infusion in 500 mL 5% Dextrose Injection, USP (recommended) as a 22-hour continuous infusion. 
*Reduce the dose of Oxaliplatin to 75 mg/m² (adjuvant setting) or 65 mg/m² (advanced colorectal cancer) (2.2): -if there are persistent grade 2 neurosensory events that do not resolve. -after recovery from grade 3/4 gastrointestinal toxicities (despite prophylactic treatment) or grade 4 neutropenia or febrile neutropenia or grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. Delay next dose until neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 109/L and platelets ≥ 75 x 109/L. 
*For patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 2.2 Dose Modification Recommendations
                     Prior to subsequent therapy cycles, patients should be evaluated for clinical toxicities and recommended laboratory tests [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. Prolongation of infusion time for Oxaliplatin from 2 hours to 6 hours may mitigate acute toxicities. The infusion times for 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin do not need to be changed. Adjuvant Therapy in Patients with Stage III Colon Cancer Neuropathy and other toxicities were graded using the NCI CTC scale version 1 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. For patients who experience persistent Grade 2 neurosensory events that do not resolve, a dose reduction of Oxaliplatin to 75 mg/m2 should be considered. For patients with persistent Grade 3 neurosensory events, discontinuing therapy should be considered. The infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin regimen need not be altered. A dose reduction of Oxaliplatin to 75 mg/m2 and infusional 5-fluorouracil to 300 mg/m2 bolus and 500 mg/m2 22 hour infusion is recommended for patients after recovery from grade 3/4 gastrointestinal (despite prophylactic treatment), or grade 4 neutropenia, or febrile neutropenia, or grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. The next dose should be delayed until: neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 109/L and platelets ≥ 75 x 109/L. Dose Modifications in Therapy in Previously Untreated and Previously Treated Patients with Advanced Colorectal Cancer Neuropathy was graded using a study-specific neurotoxicity scale [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Other toxicities were graded by the NCI CTC, Version 2.0. For patients who experience persistent Grade 2 neurosensory events that do not resolve, a dose reduction of Oxaliplatin to 65 mg/m2 should be considered. For patients with persistent Grade 3 neurosensory events, discontinuing therapy should be considered. The 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin regimen need not be altered. A dose reduction of Oxaliplatin to 65 mg/m2 and 5-fluorouracil by 20% (300 mg/m2 bolus and 500 mg/m2 22-hour infusion) is recommended for patients after recovery from grade 3/4 gastrointestinal (despite prophylactic treatment) or grade 4 neutropenia or grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. The next dose should be delayed until: neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 109/L and platelets ≥ 75 x 109/L. Dose Modifications in Therapy for Patients with Renal Impairment In patients with normal renal function or mild to moderate renal impairment, the recommended dose of Oxaliplatin is 85 mg/m2. In patients with severe renal impairment, the initial recommended Oxaliplatin dose should be reduced to 65 mg/m2 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].   2.3 Preparation of Infusion Solution Reconstitution or final dilution must never be performed with a sodium chloride solution or other chloride containing solutions. The lyophilized powder is reconstituted by adding 10 mL (for the 50 mg vial) or 20 mL (for the 100 mg vial) of Water for Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose Injection, USP. Do not administer the reconstituted solution without further dilution. The reconstituted solution must be further diluted in an infusion solution of 250-500 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP. After reconstitution in the original vial, the solution may be stored up to 24 hours under refrigeration [2-8°C (36-46°F)]. After final dilution with 250-500 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, the shelf life is 6 hours at room temperature [20-25°C (68-77°F)] or up to 24 hours under refrigeration [2-8°C (36-46°F)]. Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP is not light sensitive. Oxaliplatin Injection, USP is incompatible in solution with alkaline medications or media (such as basic solutions of 5-fluorouracil) and must not be mixed with these or administered simultaneously through the same infusion line. The infusion line should be flushed with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP prior to administration of any concomitant medication. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration and discarded if present. Needles or intravenous administration sets containing aluminum parts that may come in contact with Oxaliplatin Injection, USP should not be used for the preparation or mixing of the drug. Aluminum has been reported to cause degradation of platinum compounds. 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Oxaliplatin for Injection, USP is supplied in single-use vials containing 50 mg or 100 mg of oxaliplatin as a sterile, preservative-free lyophilized powder for reconstitution. Single-use vials of 50 mg or 100 mg oxaliplatin as a sterile, preservative-free lyophilized powder for reconstitution. (3) 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Oxaliplatin should not be administered to patients with a history of known allergy to Oxaliplatin or other platinum compounds [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 
*Known allergy to Oxaliplatin or other platinum compounds. (4, 5.1) 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 
*Allergic Reactions: Monitor for development of rash, urticaria, erythema, pruritis, bronchospasm, and hypotension. (5.1) 
*Neuropathy: Reduce the dose or discontinue Oxaliplatin if necessary. (5.2) 
*Severe Neutropenia: Delay Oxaliplatin until neutrophils are ≥1.5 x 109 L. Withhold Oxaliplatin for sepsis. (5.3) 
*Pulmonary Toxicity: May need to discontinue Oxaliplatin until interstitial lung disease or pulmonary fibrosis are excluded. (5.4) 
*Hepatotoxicity: Monitor liver function tests. (5.5) 
*Cardiovascular Toxicity: Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to initiating Oxaliplatin. (5.6) 
*Rhabdomyolysis: Discontinue Oxaliplatin if rhabdomyolysis occurs. (5.7) 
*Pregnancy. Fetal harm can occur when administered to a pregnant woman. Women should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. (5.8, 8.1) 5.1 Allergic Reactions See boxed warning Grade 3/4 hypersensitivity, including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, to Oxaliplatin has been observed in 2 to 3% of colon cancer patients. These allergic reactions which can be fatal, can occur within minutes of administration and at any cycle, and were similar in nature and severity to those reported with other platinum-containing compounds, such as rash, urticaria, erythema, pruritus, and, rarely, bronchospasm and hypotension. The symptoms associated with hypersensitivity reactions reported in the previously untreated patients were urticaria, pruritus, flushing of the face, diarrhea associated with oxaliplatin infusion, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, diaphoresis, chest pains, hypotension, disorientation and syncope. These reactions are usually managed with standard epinephrine, corticosteroid, antihistamine therapy, and require discontinuation of therapy. Rechallenge is contraindicated in these patients [see Contraindications (4) ]. Drug-related deaths associated with platinum compounds from anaphylaxis have been reported. 5.2 Neurologic Toxicity Neuropathy Oxaliplatin is associated with two types of neuropathy: An acute, reversible, primarily peripheral, sensory neuropathy that is of early onset, occurring within hours or one to two days of dosing, that resolves within 14 days, and that frequently recurs with further dosing. The symptoms may be precipitated or exacerbated by exposure to cold temperature or cold objects and they usually present as transient paresthesia, dysesthesia and hypoesthesia in the hands, feet, perioral area, or throat. Jaw spasm, abnormal tongue sensation, dysarthria, eye pain, and a feeling of chest pressure have also been observed. The acute, reversible pattern of sensory neuropathy was observed in about 56% of study patients who received Oxaliplatin with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. In any individual cycle acute neurotoxicity was observed in approximately 30% of patients. In adjuvant patients the median cycle of onset for grade 3 peripheral sensory neuropathy was 9 in the previously treated patients the median number of cycles administered on the Oxaliplatin with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin combination arm was 6. An acute syndrome of pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia seen in 1 to 2% (grade 3/4) of patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer, and the previously treated patients, is characterized by subjective sensations of dysphagia or dyspnea, without any laryngospasm or bronchospasm (no stridor or wheezing). Ice (mucositis prophylaxis) should be avoided during the infusion of Oxaliplatin because cold temperature can exacerbate acute neurological symptoms. A persistent (> 14 days), primarily peripheral, sensory neuropathy that is usually characterized by paresthesias, dysesthesias, hypoesthesias, but may also include deficits in proprioception that can interfere with daily activities (e.g., writing, buttoning, swallowing, and difficulty walking from impaired proprioception). These forms of neuropathy occurred in 48% of the study patients receiving Oxaliplatin with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Persistent neuropathy can occur without any prior acute neuropathy event. The majority of the patients (80%) who developed grade 3 persistent neuropathy progressed from prior Grade 1 or 2 events. These symptoms may improve in some patients upon discontinuation of Oxaliplatin. In the adjuvant colon cancer trial, neuropathy was graded using a prelisted module derived from the Neuro-Sensory section of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) scale, Version 1, as follows: 



 Table 1 - NCI CTC Grading for Neuropathy in Adjuvant Patients Grade Definition Grade 0 No change or none Grade 1 Mild paresthesias, loss of deep tendon reflexes Grade 2 Mild or moderate objective sensory loss, moderate paresthesias Grade 3 Severe objective sensory loss or paresthesias that interfere with function Grade 4 Not applicable Peripheral sensory neuropathy was reported in adjuvant patients treated with the Oxaliplatin combination with a frequency of 92% (all grades) and 13% (grade 3). At the 28-day follow-up after the last treatment cycle, 60% of all patients had any grade (Grade 1=40%, Grade 2=16%, Grade 3=5%) peripheral sensory neuropathy decreasing to 39% at 6 months follow-up (Grade 1=31%, Grade 2=7%, Grade 3=1%) and 21% at 18 months of follow-up (Grade 1=17%, Grade 2=3%, Grade 3=1%). In the advanced colorectal cancer studies, neuropathy was graded using a study-specific neurotoxicity scale, which was different from the NCI CTC scale, Version 2.0 (see below). 



 Table 2 - Grading Scale for Paresthesias/Dysesthesias in Advanced Colorectal Cancer Patients Grade Definition Grade 1 Resolved and did not interfere with functioning Grade 2 Interfered with function but not daily activities Grade 3 Pain or functional impairment that interfered with daily activities Grade 4 Persistent impairment that is disabling or life-threatening Overall, neuropathy was reported in patients previously untreated for advanced colorectal cancer in 82% (all grades) and 19% (grade 3/4), and in the previously treated patients in 74% (all grades) and 7% (grade 3/4) events. Information regarding reversibility of neuropathy was not available from the trial for patients who had not been previously treated for colorectal cancer. Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS, also known as PRES, Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome) has been observed in clinical trials (5.3 Severe Neutropenia
                     Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 41 to 44% of patients with colorectal cancer treated with Oxaliplatin in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin compared to 5% with 5-FU plus leucovorin alone. Sepsis, neutropenic sepsis and septic shock have been reported in patients treated with Oxaliplatin, including fatal outcomes [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Delay Oxaliplatin until neutrophils are ≥1.5 x 109/L. Withhold Oxaliplatin for sepsis or septic shock. Dose reduce Oxaliplatin after recovery from Grade 4 neutropenia or febrile neutropenia [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 5.4 Pulmonary Toxicity Oxaliplatin has been associated with pulmonary fibrosis (5.6 Cardiovascular Toxicity
                     QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias including fatal Torsade de Pointes have been reported in postmarketing experiences following Oxaliplatin administration. ECG monitoring is recommended if therapy is initiated in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, drugs known to prolong the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics, and electrolyte abnormalities. Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to initiating Oxaliplatin and monitor these electrolytes periodically during therapy. Avoid Oxaliplatin in patients with congenital long QT syndrome [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 
                        5.7 Rhabdomyolysis 
                     Rhabdomyolysis, including fatal cases, has been reported in patients treated with Oxaliplatin. Discontinue Oxaliplatin if any signs or symptoms of rhabdomyolysis occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ]. 5.8 Use in Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D Oxaliplatin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of Oxaliplatin in pregnant women. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with Oxaliplatin [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. 5.9 Recommended Laboratory Tests Standard monitoring of the white blood cell count with differential, hemoglobin, platelet count, and blood chemistries (including ALT, AST, bilirubin and creatinine) is recommended before each Oxaliplatin cycle [ see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . There have been reports while on study and from post-marketing surveillance of prolonged prothrombin time and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage in patients who received Oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin while on anticoagulants. Patients receiving Oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and requiring oral anticoagulants may require closer monitoring. 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the label: 
*Anaphylaxis and Allergic reactions [ see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 
*Neuropathy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 
*Severe Neutropenia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. 
*Pulmonary Toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. 
*Hepatotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. 
*Cardiovascular Toxicities [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. 
*Rhabdomyolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥ 40%) were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. Other adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, have been reported. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Hospira, Inc. at 1-800-441-4100, or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. More than 1100 patients with stage II or III colon cancer and more than 4,000 patients with advanced colorectal cancer have been treated in clinical studies with Oxaliplatin. The most common adverse reactions in patients with stage II or III colon cancer receiving adjuvant therapy were peripheral sensory neuropathy, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, increase in transaminases and alkaline phosphatase, diarrhea, emesis, fatigue and stomatitis. The most common adverse reactions in previously untreated and treated patients were peripheral sensory neuropathies, fatigue, neutropenia, nausea, emesis, and diarrhea [ see Warnings and Precautions (5) ] . Combination Adjuvant Therapy with Oxaliplatin and Infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin in Patients with Colon Cancer One thousand one hundred and eight patients with stage II or III colon cancer, who had undergone complete resection of the primary tumor, have been treated in a clinical study with Oxaliplatin in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin [ see Clinical Studies (14) ] . The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions was 70% on the Oxaliplatin combination arm, and 31% on the infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm. The adverse reactions in this trial are shown in the tables below. Discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions occurred in 15% of the patients receiving Oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. Both 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and Oxaliplatin are associated with gastrointestinal or hematologic adverse reactions. When Oxaliplatin is administered in combination with infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, the incidence of these events is increased. The incidence of death within 28 days of last treatment, regardless of causality, was 0.5% (n=6) in both the Oxaliplatin combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. Deaths within 60 days from initiation of therapy were 0.3% (n=3) in both the Oxaliplatin combination and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arms, respectively. On the Oxaliplatin combination arm, 3 deaths were due to sepsis/neutropenic sepsis, 2 from intracerebral bleeding and one from eosinophilic pneumonia. On the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm, one death was due to suicide, 2 from Steven-Johnson Syndrome (1 patient also had sepsis), 1 unknown cause, 1 anoxic cerebral infarction and 1 probable abdominal aorta rupture. The following table provides adverse reactions reported in the adjuvant therapy colon cancer clinical trial [ see Clinical Studies (14) ] by body system and decreasing order of frequency in the Oxaliplatin and infusional 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin arm for events with overall incidences ≥ 5% and for NCI grade 3/4 events with incidences ≥ 1%.

Clinical progression was not included in this analysis, and 18% of patients were excluded from the analysis based on unavailability of the radiographs for independent review. Arm 5-FU/LV (N = 151) Oxaliplatin (N = 156) Oxaliplatin + 5-FU/LV (N = 152) No. of progressors 74 101 50 No. of patients with no radiological evaluation beyond baseline 22 (15%) 16 (10%) 17 (11%) Median TTP (months) 2.7 1.6 4.6 95%CI 1.8-3.0 1.4-2.7 4.2-6.1 At the time of the interim analysis 49% of the radiographic progression events had occurred. In this interim analysis an estimated 2-month increase in median time to radiographic progression was observed compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone. Of the 13 patients who had tumor response to the combination of Oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, 5 were female and 8 were male, and responders included patients <65 years old and ≥ 65 years old. The small number of non-Caucasian participants made efficacy analyses in these populations uninterpretable. 15 REFERENCES 1.NIOSH Alert: Preventing occupational exposures to antineoplastic and other hazardous drugs in healthcare settings. 2004.

NDC 61703-362-50: 100 mg single use vial individually packaged in a carton. 16.2 Storage Store under normal lighting conditions at 20°-25°C (68°-77°F); excursions permitted to 15-30°C (59-86°F) [see USP controlled room temperature]. 16.3 Handling and Disposal As with other potentially toxic anticancer agents, care should be exercised in the handling and preparation of infusion solutions prepared from Oxaliplatin. The use of gloves is recommended. If a solution of Oxaliplatin contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If Oxaliplatin contacts the mucous membranes, flush thoroughly with water. Procedures for the handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be considered. Several guidelines on the subject have been published [ see References (15) ]. There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate. 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise patients: 
*To expect side effects of Oxaliplatin, particularly its neurologic effects, both the acute, reversible effects and the persistent neurosensory toxicity. Patients should be informed that the acute neurosensory toxicity may be precipitated or exacerbated by exposure to cold or cold objects. 
*To avoid cold drinks, use of ice, and should cover exposed skin prior to exposure to cold temperature or cold objects. 
*Of the risk of low blood cell counts and to contact their physician immediately should fever, particularly if associated with persistent diarrhea, or evidence of infection develop. 
*To contact their physician if persistent vomiting, diarrhea, signs of dehydration, cough or breathing difficulties occur, or signs of allergic reaction appear. 
*To exercise caution when driving and using machines. No studies on the effects of the ability to operate cars and machines have been performed; however, oxaliplatin treatment resulting in an increase risk of dizziness, nausea and vomiting, and other neurologic symptoms that affect gait and balance may lead to a minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
*Of the potential effects of vision abnormalities, in particular transient vision loss (reversible following therapy discontinuation), which may affect patients' ability to drive and use machines.

Trazodone Hydrochloride Trazodone Hydrochloride TRAZODONE HYDROCHLORIDE TRAZODONE SILICON DIOXIDE ANHYDROUS LACTOSE MAGNESIUM STEARATE CELLULOSE, MICROCRYSTALLINE SODIUM STARCH GLYCOLATE TYPE A POTATO PLIVA;441;50;50;50  Warnings and Precautions (5.12) 06/2014 WARNING: SUICIDALITY AND ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUGS Antidepressants increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of trazodone hydrochloride tablets or any other antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide. Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation and communication with the prescriber. Trazodone hydrochloride tablets are not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)]. WARNING: SUICIDALITY AND ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUGS See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Trazodone Hydrochloride Tablets USP are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults. The efficacy of Trazodone Hydrochloride Tablets USP has been established in trials with the immediate release formulation of trazodone [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Trazodone Hydrochloride Tablets USP are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (1). 
* Efficacy was established in trials of trazodone immediate release formulation in patients with major depressive disorder (14). 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The dosage should be initiated at a low-dose and increased gradually, noting the clinical response and any evidence of intolerance. Occurrence of drowsiness may require the administration of a major portion of the daily dose at bedtime or a reduction of dosage. Trazodone hydrochloride tablets should be taken shortly after a meal or light snack. Dose Selection An initial dose of 150 mg/day in divided doses is suggested. The dose may be increased by 50 mg/day every 3 to 4 days. The maximum dose for outpatients usually should not exceed 400 mg/day in divided doses. Inpatients (i.e., more severely depressed patients) may be given up to but not in excess of 600 mg/day in divided doses 
*Once an adequate response has been achieved, dosage may be gradually reduced, with subsequent adjustment depending on therapeutic response. 
*Patients should be monitored for withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing treatment with trazodone hydrochloride tablets. The dose should be gradually reduced whenever possible [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]. Maintenance Treatment The efficacy of trazodone hydrochloride tablets for the maintenance treatment of MDD has not been evaluated. While there is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long a patient treated with trazodone hydrochloride tablets should continue the drug, it is generally recommended that treatment be continued for several months after an initial response. Patients should be maintained on the lowest effective dose and be periodically reassessed to determine the continued need for maintenance treatment. Important Administration Instructions Trazodone hydrochloride tablets are scored to provide flexibility in dosing. Trazodone hydrochloride tablets can be swallowed whole or administered as a half tablet by breaking the tablet along the score line. 
* Starting dose: 150 mg in divided doses daily. May be increased by 50 mg per day every three to four days. Maximum dose: 400 mg per day in divided doses (2). 
* Trazodone hydrochloride tablets should be taken shortly after a meal or light snack (2). 
* Tablets should be swallowed whole or broken in half along the score line, and should not be chewed or crushed (2). 
* When discontinued, gradual dose reduction is recommended (2). 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS Trazodone hydrochloride tablets are available in the following strengths: 50 mg- White, round, compressed tablet, debossed “PLIVA 433” on one side and scored on the other side. 100 mg- White, round, compressed tablet, debossed “PLIVA 434” on one side and scored on the other side. 150 mg- White, trapezoid, flat-face, beveled edge tablet, scored and debossed as “PLIVA” bisect “441” on one side and tri-scored and debossed as “50” in each section on the other side. Bisectable tablets of 50 mg, 100 mg and 150 mg (3). 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS None. None (4). 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 
* Clinical Worsening/Suicide Risk: Monitor for clinical worsening and suicidal thinking and behavior (5.1). 
* Serotonin Syndrome or Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome-Like 

Reactions: Have been reported with antidepressants. Discontinue trazodone hydrochloride tablets and initiate supportive treatment (5.2, 7). 
* Activation of Mania/Hypomania: Screen for bipolar disorder and monitor for mania/hypomania (5.3). 
* QT Prolongation: Increases the QT interval. Avoid use with drugs that also increase the QT interval and in patients with risk factors for prolonged QT interval (5.4). 
* Use in Patients With Heart Disease: Use with caution in patients with cardiac disease (5.5). 
* Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope: Have occurred. Warn patients of risk and symptoms of hypotension (5.6). 
* Abnormal Bleeding: May increase the risk of bleeding. Use with NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation may compound this risk (5.7, 7). 
* Interaction With MAOIs: Do not use concomitantly or within 14 days of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (5.8, 7). 
* Priapism: Has occurred. Warn male patients of this risk and how/when to seek medical attention (5.9). 
* Hyponatremia: Can occur in association with SIADH (5.10). 
* Potential for Cognitive and Motor Impairment: Has potential to impair judgment, thinking, and motor skills. Advise patients to use caution when operating machinery (5.11). 
*Angle-Closure Glaucoma: Angle closure glaucoma has occurred in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles treated with antidepressants. (5.12) 
* Discontinuation Symptoms: May occur with abrupt discontinuation and include anxiety and sleep disturbance. Upon discontinuation, taper trazodone hydrochloride tablets and monitor for symptoms (5.13). 5.1 Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of depression and certain other psychiatric disorders and these disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There has been a long standing concern, however, that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18 to 24) with MDD and other psychiatric disorders. Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65 and older. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9 antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients. The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000 patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs. placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference in the number of cases of suicidality per 1,000 patients treated) are provided in Table 1.

In addition to the relatively common (i.e., greater than 1%) untoward events enumerated above, the following adverse events have been reported to occur in association with the use of trazodone hydrochloride in the controlled clinical studies: akathisia, allergic reaction, anemia, chest pain, delayed urine flow, early menses, flatulence, hallucinations/delusions, hematuria, hyper-salivation, hypomania, impaired speech, impotence, increased appetite, increased libido, increased urinary frequency, missed periods, muscle twitches, numbness, and retrograde ejaculation. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Spontaneous reports regarding trazodone hydrochloride received from postmarketing experience include the following: abnormal dreams, agitation, alopecia, anxiety, aphasia, apnea, ataxia, breast enlargement or engorgement, cardiospasm, cerebrovascular accident, chills, cholestasis, clitorism, congestive heart failure, diplopia, edema, extrapyramidal symptoms, grand mal seizures, hallucinations, hemolytic anemia, hirsutism, hyperbilirubinemia, increased amylase, increased salivation, insomnia, leukocytosis, leukonychia, jaundice, lactation, liver enzyme alterations, methemoglobinemia, nausea/vomiting (most frequently), paresthesia, paranoid reaction, priapism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Patient Counseling Information (17.1)], pruritus, psoriasis, psychosis, rash, stupor, inappropriate ADH syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, unexplained death, urinary incontinence, urinary retention, urticaria, vasodilation, vertigo, and weakness. Cardiovascular system effects which have been reported include the following: conduction block, orthostatic hypotension and syncope, palpitations, bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, ventricular ectopic activity, including ventricular tachycardia and QT prolongation. In postmarketing surveillance, prolonged QT interval, torsade de pointes, and ventricular tachycardia have been reported with the immediate-release form of trazodone at doses of 100 mg per day or less [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS MAOIs MAOIs should not be used within 14 days of trazodone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants Trazodone may enhance the response to alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants. Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors In vitro drug metabolism studies suggest that there is a potential for drug interactions when trazodone is given with cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors. The effect of short-term administration of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily, 4 doses) on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of trazodone (50 mg) has been studied in 10 healthy subjects. The Cmax of trazodone increased by 34%, the AUC increased 2.4 fold, the half-life increased by 2.2 fold, and the clearance decreased by 52%. Adverse effects including nausea, hypotension, and syncope were observed when ritonavir and trazodone were coadministered. It is likely that ketoconazole, indinavir, and other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole may lead to substantial increases in trazodone plasma concentrations with the potential for adverse effects. If trazodone is used with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, the risk of cardiac arrhythmia may be increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] and a lower dose of trazodone should be considered. Cytochrome P450 Inducers (e.g., Carbamazepine) Carbamazepine induces CYP3A4. Following coadministration of carbamazepine 400 mg per day with trazodone 100 mg to 300 mg daily, carbamazepine reduced plasma concentrations of trazodone and m-chlorophenlypiperazine (an active metabolite) by 76% and 60% respectively, compared to pre-carbamazepine values. Patients should be closely monitored to see if there is a need for an increased dose of trazodone when taking both drugs. Digoxin and Phenytoin Increased serum digoxin or phenytoin levels have been reported in patients receiving trazodone concurrently with either of these drugs. Monitor serum levels and adjust dosages as needed. Serotonergic Drugs Based on the mechanism of action of trazodone and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when trazodone is coadministered with other drugs that may affect the neurotransmitter systems [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. NSAIDs, Aspirin, or Other Drugs Affecting Coagulation or Bleeding Due to a possible association between serotonin modulating drugs and gastrointestinal bleeding, patients should be monitored for and cautioned about the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of trazodone and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation or bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Warfarin There have been reports of altered (either increased or decreased) prothrombin times in taking both warfarin and trazodone. 
* CNS Depressants: Trazodone may enhance effects of alcohol, barbiturates, or other CNS depressants (7). 
* CYP3A4 Inhibitors: May necessitate lower dose of trazodone hydrochloride tablets (7). 
* CYP3A4 Inducers (e.g., Carbamazepine): May necessitate higher dose of trazodone hydrochloride tablets (7). 
* Digoxin or Phenytoin: Monitor for increased serum levels (7). 
* Warfarin: Monitor for increased or decreased prothrombin time (7). 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 
* Pregnancy: Based on animal data, may cause fetal harm (8.1). 
* Nursing Mothers: Use with caution (8.3). 
* Pediatric Patients: trazodone hydrochloride tablets are not approved in pediatric patients (8.4). 
* Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Use with caution (8.6, 8.7). 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Trazodone hydrochloride has been shown to cause increased fetal resorption and other adverse effects on the fetus in two studies using the rat when given at dose levels approximately 30 to 50 times the proposed maximum human dose. There was also an increase in congenital anomalies in one of three rabbit studies at approximately 15 to 50 times the maximum human dose. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Trazodone hydrochloride should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Trazodone and/or its metabolites have been found in the milk of lactating rats, suggesting that the drug may be secreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when trazodone is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population have not been established [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Trazodone hydrochloride should not be used in children or adolescents. 8.5 Geriatric Use Reported clinical literature and experience with trazodone has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. However, as experience in the elderly with trazodone hydrochloride is limited, it should be used with caution in geriatric patients. Antidepressants have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment Trazodone has not been studied in patients with renal impairment. Trazodone should be used with caution in this population. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Trazodone has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. Trazodone should be used with caution in this population. 9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE 9.1 Controlled Substance Trazodone hydrochloride tablets are not a controlled substance. 9.2 Abuse Although trazodone hydrochloride has not been systematically studied in preclinical or clinical studies for its potential for abuse, no indication of drug-seeking behavior was seen in the clinical studies with trazodone hydrochloride. However, it is difficult to predict the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and abused. Consequently, physicians should carefully evaluate patients for a history of drug abuse and follow such patients closely, observing them for signs of misuse or abuse of trazodone hydrochloride (e.g., development of tolerance, incrementation of dose, drug-seeking behavior). 10 OVERDOSAGE 10.1 Human Experience Death from overdose has occurred in patients ingesting trazodone and other CNS depressant drugs concurrently (alcohol; alcohol and chloral hydrate and diazepam; amobarbital; chlordiazepoxide; or meprobamate). The most severe reactions reported to have occurred with overdose of trazodone alone have been priapism, respiratory arrest, seizures, and ECG changes, including QT prolongation. The reactions reported most frequently have been drowsiness and vomiting. Overdosage may cause an increase in incidence or severity of any of the reported adverse reactions. 10.2 Management of Overdose There is no specific antidote for trazodone hydrochloride overdose. Treatment should consist of those general measures employed in the management of overdosage with any drug effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Ensure an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation. Monitor cardiac rhythm and vital signs. General supportive and symptomatic measures are also recommended. Induction of emesis is not recommended. Gastric lavage with a large bore orogastric tube with appropriate airway protection, if needed, may be indicated if performed soon after ingestion, or in symptomatic patients. Activated charcoal should be administered. Forced diuresis may be useful in facilitating elimination of the drug. In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison control center for additional information on the treatment of any overdose. 11 DESCRIPTION Trazodone hydrochloride, USP is an antidepressant chemically unrelated to tricyclic, tetracyclic, or other known antidepressant agents. Trazodone hydrochloride, USP is a triazolopyridine derivative designated as 2-[3-[4-(3-chlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]propyl]-1,2,4-triazolo[4, 3-a]pyridin-3(2H)-one hydrochloride. It is a white, odorless crystalline powder which is freely soluble in water. The structural formula is represented as follows: C19H22ClN5O · HCl M. W. 408.32 Each tablet, for oral administration, contains 50 mg, 100 mg or 150 mg of trazodone hydrochloride, USP. In addition, each tablet contains colloidal silicon dioxide, lactose anhydrous, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose and sodium starch glycolate. structural formula 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of trazodone’s antidepressant action is not fully understood, but is thought to be related to its potentiation of serotonergic activity in the CNS. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Preclinical studies have shown that trazodone selectively inhibits neuronal reuptake of serotonin and acts as an antagonist at 5-HT-2A/2C serotonin receptors. Trazodone is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and, unlike amphetamine-type drugs, does not stimulate the central nervous system. Trazodone antagonizes alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, a property which may be associated with postural hypotension. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption In humans, trazodone hydrochloride is well absorbed after oral administration without selective localization in any tissue. When trazodone hydrochloride is taken shortly after ingestion of food, there may be an increase in the amount of drug absorbed, a decrease in maximum concentration and a lengthening in the time to maximum concentration. Peak plasma levels occur approximately one hour after dosing when trazodone hydrochloride is taken on an empty stomach or 2 hours after dosing when taken with food. Metabolism In vitro studies in human liver microsomes show that trazodone is metabolized, via oxidative cleavage, to an active metabolite, m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) by CYP3A4. Other metabolic pathways that may be involved in the metabolism of trazodone have not been well characterized. Trazodone is extensively metabolized; less than 1% of an oral dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Elimination In some patients trazodone may accumulate in the plasma. Protein Binding Trazodone is 89 to 95% protein bound in vitro at concentrations attained with therapeutic doses in humans. 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No drug- or dose-related occurrence of carcinogenesis was evident in rats receiving trazodone in daily oral doses up to 300 mg/kg for 18 months. 14 CLINICAL STUDIES The efficacy and safety of trazodone hydrochloride was established from both inpatient and outpatient trials of the trazodone immediate release formulation in the treatment of major depressive disorder. 16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING Trazodone Hydrochloride Tablets USP are available as follows: 150 mg: White, trapezoid, flat-face, beveled edge tablet, scored and debossed as “PLIVA” bisect “441” on one side and tri-scored and debossed as “50” in each section on the other side.

Patients should be warned that: 
*There is a potential for increased risk of suicidal thoughts especially in children, teenagers and young adults. 
*The following symptoms should be reported to the physician: anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, hypomania and mania. 
*They should inform their physician if they have a history of bipolar disorder, cardiac disease or myocardial infarction. 
*Serotonin syndrome could occur and symptoms may include changes in mental status (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, and hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations (e.g., hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea). 
*Trazodone hydrochloride has been associated with the occurrence of priapism. 
*There is a potential for hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope. 
*There is a potential risk of bleeding (including life-threatening hemorrhages) and bleeding related events (including ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae) with the concomitant use of trazodone hydrochloride and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation or bleeding. 
*Withdrawal symptoms including anxiety, agitation and sleep disturbances, have been reported with trazodone. Clinical experience suggests that the dose should be gradually reduced. 
*Patients should be advised that taking trazodone hydrochloride tablets can cause mild pupillary dilation, which in susceptible individuals, can lead to an episode of angle-closure glaucoma. Pre-existing glaucoma is almost always open-angle glaucoma because angle closure glaucoma, when diagnosed, can be treated definitively with iridectomy. Open-angle glaucoma is not a risk factor for angle-closure glaucoma. Patients may wish to be examined to determine whether they are susceptible to angle closure, and have a prophylactic procedure (e.g., iridectomy), if they are susceptible. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)] Patients should be counseled that: 
*Trazodone may cause somnolence or sedation and may impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks. Patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles until they are reasonably certain that the drug treatment does not affect them. 
*Trazodone may enhance the response to alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants. 
*Women who intend to become pregnant or who are breastfeeding should discuss with a physician whether they should continue to use trazodone, since use in pregnant and nursing women is not recommended. Important Administration Instructions: 
*Trazodone hydrochloride tablets should be swallowed whole or broken in half along the score line. 
*Trazodone hydrochloride tablets should be taken shortly after a meal or light snack. Manufactured In Croatia By: PLIVA HRVATSKA d.o.o.

Loperamide hydrochloride is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Avoid loperamide hydrochloride dosages higher than recommended in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older due to the risk of serious cardiac adverse reactions (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). DESCRIPTION Loperamide hydrochloride is a white to slightly yellow powder and is freely soluble in methanol, isopropyl alcohol, chloroform and slightly soluble in water. Loperamide hydrochloride, 4-(p-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyl-α,α-diphenyl-1-piperidinebutyramide monohydrochloride, is a synthetic antidiarrheal for oral use. Its structural formula is: C 29H 33ClN 2O 2
*HCl M.W. 513.51 Loperamide hydrochloride is available in 2 mg capsules. Each capsule, for oral administration, contains 2 mg loperamide hydrochloride. Loperamide hydrochloride capsules USP also contain the inactive ingredients: dimethylpolysiloxane, gelatin, iron oxide black, iron oxide red, iron oxide yellow, lactose monohydrate, pregelatinized corn starch, magnesium stearate, shellac, and titanium dioxide. Structural formula for loperaminde hydrochloride CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY In vitro and animal studies show that loperamide hydrochloride acts by slowing intestinal motility and by affecting water and electrolyte movement through the bowel. Loperamide binds to the opiate receptor in the gut wall. Consequently, it inhibits the release of acetylcholine and prostaglandins, thereby reducing peristalsis, and increasing intestinal transit time. Loperamide increases the tone of the anal sphincter, thereby reducing incontinence and urgency. In man, loperamide hydrochloride prolongs the transit time of the intestinal contents. It reduces the daily fecal volume, increases the viscosity and bulk density, and diminishes the loss of fluid and electrolytes. Tolerance to the antidiarrheal effect has not been observed. Clinical studies have indicated that the apparent elimination half-life of loperamide hydrochloride in man is 10.8 hours with a range of 9.1 to 14.4 hours. Plasma levels of unchanged drug remain below 2 nanograms per mL after the intake of a 2 mg loperamide hydrochloride capsule. Plasma levels are highest approximately five hours after administration of the capsule and 2.5 hours after the liquid. The peak plasma levels of loperamide were similar for both formulations. Elimination of loperamide mainly occurs by oxidative N-demethylation. Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isozymes, CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, are thought to play an important role in loperamide N-demethylation process since quercetin (CYP2C8 inhibitor) and ketoconazole (CYP3A4 inhibitor) significantly inhibited the N-demethylation process in vitro by 40% and 90%, respectively. In addition, CYP2B6 and CYP2D6 appear to play a minor role in loperamide N-demethylation. Concomitant use of loperamide hydrochloride with inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole) or CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) or inhibitors of P-glycoprotein (e.g., quinidine, ritonavir) can increase exposure to loperamide (see PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions). Excretion of the unchanged loperamide and its metabolites mainly occurs through the feces. In those patients in whom biochemical and hematological parameters were monitored during clinical trials, no trends toward abnormality during loperamide hydrochloride therapy were noted. Similarly, urinalyses, EKG and clinical ophthalmological examinations did not show trends toward abnormality. INDICATIONS AND USAGE Loperamide hydrochloride capsules are indicated for the control and symptomatic relief of acute nonspecific diarrhea in patients 2 years of age and older and of chronic diarrhea in adults associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Loperamide hydrochloride is also indicated for reducing the volume of discharge from iloestomies. CONTRAINDICATIONS Loperamide hydrochloride capsules are contraindicated in: pediatric patients less than 2 years of age due to the risks of respiratory depression and serious cardiac adverse reactions (see WARNINGS). patients with a known hypersensitivity to loperamide hydrochloride or to any of the excipients. patients with abdominal pain in the absence of diarrhea. patients with acute dysentery, which is characterized by blood in stools and high fever. patients with acute ulcerative colitis. patients with bacterial enterocolitis caused by invasive organisms including Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter. patients with pseudomembranous colitis associated with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. WARNINGS Cardiac Adverse Reactions, Including Torsades de Pointes and Sudden Death Cases of prolongation of the QT/QTc interval, Torsades de Pointes, other ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, some resulting in death, have been reported in adults with use of higher than recommended dosages of loperamide hydrochloride. Cases include patients who were abusing or misusing loperamide hydrochloride (see OVERDOSAGE and DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE). Cases of syncope and ventricular tachycardia have been reported in adult patients receiving the recommended dosage of loperamide hydrochloride capsules. Some of these patients were taking other drugs or had other risk factors that may have increased their risk of cardiac adverse reactions. Additionally, postmarketing cases of cardiac arrest, syncope, and respiratory depression have been reported in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age. Loperamide hydrochloride is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age due to the risks of respiratory depression and serious cardiac adverse reactions. Avoid loperamide hydrochloride dosages higher than recommended in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older due to the risk of serious cardiac adverse reactions (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, OVERDOSAGE) Avoid loperamide hydrochloride in: combination with others drugs or herbal products that are known to prolong the QT interval, including Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics (e.g., chlorpromazine, haloperidol, thioridazine, ziprasidone), antibiotics (e.g., moxifloxacin), or any other drug known to prolong the QT interval (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone) patients with risk factors for QT prolongation, including patients with congenital long QT syndrome, with a history of cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac conditions, elderly patients and those with electrolyte abnormalities. Fluid and electrolyte depletion often occur in patients who have diarrhea. In such cases, administration of appropriate fluid and electrolytes is very important. The use of loperamide hydrochloride does not preclude the need for appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy. In general, loperamide hydrochloride should not be used when inhibition of peristalsis is to be avoided due to the possible risk of significant sequelae including ileus, megacolon and toxic megacolon. Loperamide hydrochloride must be discontinued promptly when constipation, abdominal distention or ileus develop. Treatment of diarrhea with loperamide hydrochloride is only symptomatic. Whenever an underlying etiology can be determined, specific treatment should be given when appropriate (or when indicated). Patients with AIDS treated with loperamide hydrochloride for diarrhea should have therapy stopped at the earliest signs of abdominal distention. There have been isolated reports of toxic megacolon in AIDS patients with infectious colitis from both viral and bacterial pathogens treated with loperamide hydrochloride. {ref EDMS-PSDB-2564186, p. 12} Variability in Pediatric Response Loperamide hydrochloride should be used with special caution in young children because of the greater variability of response in this age group. Dehydration, particularly in younger children, may further influence the variability of response to loperamide hydrochloride. Loperamide hydrochloride is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age due to the risks of respiratory depression and serious cardiac adverse reactions. PRECAUTIONS General Extremely rare allergic reactions including anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock have been reported. In acute diarrhea, if clinical improvement is not observed in 48 hours, the administration of loperamide hydrochloride should be discontinued and patients should be advised to consult their physician. Although no pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic impairment, loperamide hydrochloride should be used with caution in such patients because of reduced first pass metabolism. Patients with hepatic dysfunction should be monitored closely for signs of CNS toxicity. No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with renal impairment. Since it has been reported that the majority of the drug is metabolized and metabolites or the unchanged drug is excreted mainly in the feces, dosage adjustments in patients with renal impairment are not required. No formal studies have been conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of loperamide in elderly subjects. However, in two studies that enrolled elderly patients, there were no major differences in the drug disposition in elderly patients with diarrhea relative to young patients. In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval. Avoid loperamide hydrochloride in elderly patients taking drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, Class IA or III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (see WARNINGS). Information for Patients Advise patients: to take loperamide hydrochloride at the prescribed dosage. Use of a higher than prescribed dosage is not recommended (see WARNINGS). Report to a healthcare facility if you or someone you are caring for taking loperamide hydrochloride experiences fainting episode, a rapid or irregular heartbeat or become unresponsive. to tell their healthcare provider about all the medications they are taking, including prescription and over-the-counter medications, vitamins and herbal supplements, especially if they take Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics (e.g., chlorpromazine, haloperidol, thioridazine, ziprasidone), antibiotics (e.g., moxifloxacin), or any other drug known to prolong the QT interval (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone). Patients should be advised to check with their physician if their diarrhea does not improve in 48 hours or if they note blood in their stools, develop a fever or develop abdominal distention. Tiredness, dizziness, or drowsiness may occur in the setting of diarrheal syndromes treated with loperamide hydrochloride. Therefore, it is advisable to use caution when driving a car or operating machinery. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS.) Drug Interactions Effects of Other Drugs on Loperamide Concomitant use of loperamide hydrochloride with inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole) or CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) or inhibitors of P-glycoprotein (e.g., quinidine, ritonavir) can increase exposure to loperamide. The increased systemic exposure to loperamide may increase a risk for cardiac adverse reactions especially in patients who are taking multiple CYP enzyme inhibitors, or in patients with underlying cardiac conditions (see WARNINGS). Monitor patients for cardiac adverse reactions. CYP3A4 Inhibitors Itraconazole Concomitant administration of multiple doses of 100 mg itraconazole twice daily, an inhibitor of both CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein, with a single 4 mg dose of loperamide hydrochloride increased the peak plasma concentration and the systemic exposure to loperamide by 2.9-fold and 3.8-fold, respectively. CYP2C8 Inhibitors Gemfibrozil When a single 4 mg dose of loperamide hydrochloride was coadministered with 600 mg gemfibrozil, a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8, on day 3 of a 5-day treatment with gemfibrozil twice daily, the mean peak plasma concentration and the systemic exposure to loperamide was increased by 1.6-fold and 2.2-fold, respectively. CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 Inhibitors When multiple doses of both 100 mg itraconazole and 600 mg gemfibrozil twice daily were administered with a single 4 mg dose of loperamide hydrochloride, the mean peak plasma concentration and the systemic exposure was increased by 4.2-fold and 12.6-fold, respectively. P-glycoprotein Inhibitors Concomitant administration of a 16 mg single dose of loperamide hydrochloride with a 600 mg single dose of quinidine or ritonavir, both of which are P-glycoprotein inhibitors, resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in loperamide plasma concentrations. Due to the potential for enhanced CNS adverse reactions when loperamide is coadministered with quinidine and with ritonavir, caution should be exercised when loperamide hydrochloride capsules are administered at the recommended dosages (2 mg, up to 16 mg maximum daily dose) with P-glycoprotein inhibitors. When a single 16 mg dose of loperamide is coadministered with a 600 mg single dose of saquinavir, loperamide decreased saquinavir exposure by 54%, which may be of clinical relevance due to reduction of therapeutic efficacy of saquinavir. The effect of saquinavir on loperamide is of less clinical significance. Therefore, when loperamide is given with saquinavir, the therapeutic efficacy of saquinavir should be closely monitored. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In an 18 month rat study with oral doses up to 40 mg/kg/day (21 times the maximum human dose of 16 mg/day, based on a body surface area comparison), there was no evidence of carcinogenesis. Loperamide was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the SOS chromotest in E. coli, the dominant lethal test in female mice, or the mouse embryo cell transformation assay. Fertility and reproductive performance was evaluated in rats using oral doses of 2.5, 10, and 40 mg/kg/day in one study, and 1, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg/day (females only) in a second study. Oral administration of 20 mg/kg/day (approximately 11 times the human dose based on a body surface area comparison) and higher produced strong impairment of female fertility. Treatment of female rats with up to 10 mg/kg/day p.o. (approximately 5 times the human dose based on a body surface area comparison) had no effect on fertility. Treatment of male rats with 40 mg/kg/day p.o. (approximately 21 times the human dose based on a body surface area comparison) produced impairment of male fertility, whereas administration of up to 10 mg/kg/day (approximately 5 times the human dose based on a body surface area comparison) had no effect. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy category C Teratology studies have been performed in rats using oral doses of 2.5, 10, and 40 mg/kg/day, and in rabbits using oral doses of 5, 20, and 40 mg/kg/day. These studies have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day in rats (5 times the human dose based on body surface area comparison) and 40 mg/kg/day in rabbits (43 times the human dose based on body surface area comparison). Treatment of rats with 40 mg/kg/day p.o. (21 times the human dose based on a body surface area comparison) produced marked impairment of fertility. The studies produced no evidence of teratogenic activity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Loperamide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Non-teratogenic Effects In a peri- and post-natal reproduction study in rats, oral administration of 40 mg/kg/day produced impairment of growth and survival of offspring. Nursing Mothers Small amounts of loperamide may appear in human breast milk. Therefore, loperamide hydrochloride is not recommended during breast-feeding. Pediatric Use Loperamide hydrochloride is contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age due to the risks of respiratory depression and serious cardiac adverse reactions (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Postmarketing cases of cardiac arrest, syncope, and respiratory depression have been reported in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age (see WARNINGS). Pediatric patients may be more sensitive to CNS effects, such as altered mental status, somnolence, and respiratory depression, than adults. In case of accidental overdosage of loperamide hydrochloride by pediatric patients, see OVERDOSAGE section for suggested treatment. ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trial Data The adverse effects reported during clinical investigations of loperamide hydrochloride are difficult to distinguish from symptoms associated with the diarrheal syndrome. Adverse experiences recorded during clinical studies with loperamide hydrochloride were generally of a minor and self-limiting nature. They were more commonly observed during the treatment of chronic diarrhea. The adverse events reported are summarized irrespective of the causality assessment of the investigators. 1) Adverse events from 4 placebo-controlled studies in patients with acute diarrhea The adverse events with an incidence of 1.0% or greater, which were reported at least as often in patients on loperamide hydrochloride as on placebo, are presented in the table below. 





 Acute Diarrhea Loperamide Hydrochloride Placebo No. of treated patients 231 236 Gastrointestinal AE% Constipation 2.6% 0.8% The adverse events with an incidence of 1.0% or greater, which were more frequently reported in patients on placebo than on loperamide hydrochloride were: dry mouth, flatulence, abdominal cramp and colic. 2) Adverse events from 20 placebo-controlled studies in patients with chronic diarrhea The adverse events with an incidence of 1.0% or greater, which were reported at least as often in patients on loperamide hydrochloride as on placebo, are presented below in the table below. 





 Chronic Diarrhea Loperamide Hydrochloride Placebo No. of treated patients 285 277 Gastrointestinal AE%     Constipation 5.3% 0% Central and peripheral nervous system AE% Dizziness 1.4% 0.7% The adverse events with an incidence of 1.0% or greater, which were more frequently reported in patients on placebo than on loperamide hydrochloride were: nausea, vomiting, headache, meteorism, abdominal pain, abdominal cramp and colic. 3) Adverse events from seventy-six controlled and uncontrolled studies in patients with acute or chronic diarrhea The adverse events with an incidence of 1.0% or greater in patients from all studies are given in the table below. 





 Acute Diarrhea Chronic Diarrhea All Studies All patients in all studies, including those in which it was not specified if the adverse events occurred in patients with acute or chronic diarrhea. No. of treated patients 1913 1371 3740 Gastrointestinal AE%       Nausea 0.7% 3.2% 1.8% Constipation 1.6% 1.9% 1.7% Abdominal cramps 0.5% 3.0% 1.4% Postmarketing Experience The following adverse events have been reported: Cardiac disorders QT/QTc-interval prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, other ventricular arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, syncope, and death (see WARNINGS, OVERDOSAGE). Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders Rash, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, and extremely rare cases of bullous eruption including erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis have been reported with use of loperamide hydrochloride. Immune System Disorders Isolated occurrences of allergic reactions and in some cases severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic shock and anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with the use of loperamide hydrochloride. Gastrointestinal Disorders Dry mouth, abdominal pain, distention or discomfort, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, dyspepsia, constipation, paralytic ileus, megacolon, including toxic megacolon (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS). Renal and Urinary Disorders Urinary retention. Nervous System Disorders Drowsiness, dizziness. General Disorders and Administrative Site Conditions Tiredness. A number of the adverse events reported during the clinical investigations and postmarketing experience with loperamide are frequent symptoms of the underlying diarrheal syndrome (abdominal pain/discomfort, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, tiredness, drowsiness, dizziness, constipation, and flatulence). These symptoms are often difficult to distinguish from undesirable drug effects. DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE Controlled Substance Loperamide is not a controlled substance. Abuse Loperamide is a mu-opioid agonist. A human abuse potential study of loperamide at single doses up to 60 mg (3.75 times the recommended maximum adult dosage of 16 mg per day) was compared, in a double-blind cross-over design using nine subjects who had been active opiate users, to a threshold dose of codeine sulfate at 120 mg (96 mg base) or placebo. This resulted in one subject (11%) feeling a drug on placebo and identifying it as ""dope"" (heroin) and liking it slightly. Codeine was felt by 56% of subjects and identified as ""dope"" by 44%. Loperamide was felt by 44% of subjects and identified as ""dope"" by 11% and possibly dope mixed with some other kind of drug by another 22%. Loperamide abuse and misuse have been reported, especially at doses of 60 mg or greater. Loperamide can have greater CNS opioid effects at higher doses or with coadministration of drugs that increase systemic exposure and/or increase CNS penetration of loperamide (through inhibition of the CYP450 enzyme system or inhibition of P-glycoprotein). Loperamide is primarily being misused for relief from opioid withdrawal, and abused by a few users who obtain some (reportedly mild-moderate) level of euphoria. Dependence In animals, parenteral administration of loperamide hydrochloride can cause physical dependence, cross-tolerance to opioids, and all the other pharmacologic effects typical of mu-opioid agonists. Studies in morphine-dependent monkeys demonstrated that loperamide hydrochloride at doses above those recommended for humans prevented signs of morphine withdrawal. OVERDOSAGE The use of higher than recommended loperamide hydrochloride doses may result in life-threatening cardiac, CNS and respiratory adverse reactions. If over-exposure occurs, call your Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 for current information on the management of poisoning or overdosage. Cardiac Effects Symptoms Cases of overdosage with loperamide (chronic ingestion of doses ranging from 70 mg to 1600 mg daily; 4 to 100 times the recommended dose) have resulted in life-threatening cardiac adverse reactions, including QT/QTc and QRS interval prolongation, Torsades de Pointes, Brugada syndrome and other ventricular arrhythmias, syncope, cardiac arrest, and death. Cases include patients who were abusing (using supratherapeutic doses in place of opioids to induce euphoria) or misusing (taking higher than recommended doses to control diarrhea or to prevent opioid withdrawal) loperamide. The following are representative cases that included cardiac adverse reactions: 25 year old abused loperamide and presented to the hospital on multiple occasions with symptoms of syncope, nausea, vomiting, bradycardia, hypotensive shock. The patient also experienced ventricular tachycardia, a prolonged QTc of 527 ms and QRS interval of 170 ms, frequent premature ventricular contractions, and subsequent cardiac arrest and death (elevated loperamide blood concentration of 32 ng/ml). 54 year old misused loperamide (up to144 mg per day) as a self-treatment for chronic diarrhea for over 2 years. Signs of cardiac toxicity included syncope, prolonged QT of 500 ms, sinus arrest with junctional escape rhythm, and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, which required cardioversion and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) management. 26 year old, with prior opioid abuse, presented to the hospital with recurrent syncope and developed TdP requiring electrical cardioversion. An ECG revealed a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 85 bpm and a markedly prolonged QTc interval of greater than 700 ms. The patient reported ingesting 100 to 250 mg of loperamide with 400 mg of cimetidine daily for several months to simulate the euphoric sensation associated with opioids. Management Consider loperamide as a possible cause of cardiac arrhythmias in patients who may have a history of opioid abuse or recent ingestion of unknown drugs and in the differential diagnosis of unstable arrhythmias, prolonged QTc or QRS intervals, and Torsades de Pointes. If loperamide-induced cardiac toxicity is suspected, promptly discontinue the drug and initiate therapy to manage and prevent cardiac arrhythmias and serious outcomes. In many cases of loperamide overdosage, anti-arrhythmic medications (e.g., magnesium sulfate) were ineffective in resolving the arrhythmias and preventing further episodes of Torsades de Pointes. Electrical cardioversion and overdrive pacing, and isoproterenol continuous infusion were reported to manage QTc prolongation in the setting of overdose. Laboratory Testing Loperamide serum concentrations are not widely available or clinically useful to guide patient management. CNS and Respiratory Depression Symptoms Cases of loperamide overdose (including relative overdose due to hepatic dysfunction), may cause opioid toxic effects including CNS depression (e.g., altered mental status, stupor, coordination disorders, somnolence, miosis, muscular hypertonia, respiratory depression), hypotension, urinary retention, and paralytic ileus. Pediatric patients may be more sensitive to CNS effects, including respiratory depression, than adults. Management Loperamide non-cardiac arrhythmia overdosages should be treated as opioid overdosages. Naloxone may reverse the opioid-related toxicity, including CNS and respiratory depression, and hypotension, associated with loperamide overdosage. In adults and pediatric patients, naloxone may be administered intravenously. Appropriate doses of naloxone, via intranasal, intramuscular, intraosseus, or subcutaneous administration may be necessary if the intravenous route is not available. If the desired degree of opioid-related toxicity counteraction and improvement are not obtained, naloxone may be repeated at two- to three-minute intervals. If no response in opioid-related effects is observed after naloxone has been administered, then diagnosis of opioid-induced toxicity should be questioned. Refer to the naloxone prescribing information for complete information on initial and subsequent dosages. For patients whose adverse reactions are responsive to naloxone, monitor vital signs, neurologic and cardiopulmonary status for recurrence of opioid overdose symptoms for at least 24 hours after the last dose of naloxone, due to the prolonged intestinal retention of loperamide and the short duration (one to three hours) of naloxone. Patients with severe CNS or respiratory depression, and those who require multiple doses of naloxone to reverse symptoms, should be admitted to the hospital and may require intensive care. Laboratory Testing Standard drug screens for opioids do not include an assay for loperamide; such testing for opioids will yield negative results even in the presence of loperamide. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Loperamide hydrochloride capsules are contraindicated in pediatric patients less than 2 years of age due to the risks of respiratory depression and serious cardiac adverse reactions (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Avoid loperamide hydrochloride dosages higher than recommended in adult or pediatric patients 2 years of age and older due to the risk of serious cardiac adverse reactions (See WARNINGS, OVERDOSAGE). (1 capsule = 2 mg) Patients should receive appropriate fluid and electrolyte replacement as needed. Acute Diarrhea Adults and Pediatric Patients 13 Years and Older: The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool. The maximum daily dose is 16 mg (eight capsules). Clinical improvement is usually observed within 48 hours. Pediatric Patients 2 to 12 Years of Age: In pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age (20 kg or less), the non-prescription liquid formulation (loperamide hydrochloride oral solution 1 mg/5 mL) should be used; for ages 6 to 12, either loperamide hydrochloride capsules or loperamide hydrochloride oral solution may be used. For pediatric patients 2 to 12 years of age, the following schedule for capsules or liquid will usually fulfill initial dosage requirements. Recommended First Day Dosage Schedule Two to five years (13 to 20 kg): 1 mg three times daily (3 mg total daily dosage) Six to eight years (20 to 30 kg): 2 mg twice daily (4 mg total daily dosage) Eight to twelve years (greater than 30 kg): 2 mg three times daily (6 mg total daily dosage) Recommended Subsequent Daily Dosage Following the first treatment day, it is recommended that subsequent loperamide hydrochloride doses (1 mg/10 kg body weight) be administered only after a loose stool. The total daily dosage should not exceed recommended dosages for the first day. Chronic Diarrhea Children Although loperamide hydrochloride has been studied in a limited number of children with chronic diarrhea; the therapeutic dose for the treatment of chronic diarrhea in a pediatric population has not been established. Adults The recommended initial dose is 4 mg (two capsules) followed by 2 mg (one capsule) after each unformed stool until diarrhea is controlled, after which the dosage of loperamide hydrochloride capsules should be reduced to meet individual requirements. When the optimal daily dosage has been established, this amount may then be administered as a single dose or in divided doses. The average daily maintenance dosage in clinical trials was 4 to 8 mg (two to four capsules per day). The maximum daily dosage is 16 mg (eight capsules per day). If clinical improvement is not observed after treatment with 16 mg per day for at least 10 days, symptoms are unlikely to be controlled by further administration. Loperamide hydrochloride capsules administration may be continued if diarrhea cannot be adequately controlled with diet or specific treatment. Children Under 2 Years There have been rare reports of paralytic ileus associated with abdominal distention. Most of these reports occurred in the setting of acute dysentery, overdose, and with very young children less than two years of age. Elderly No formal pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in elderly subjects. However, there were no major differences reported in the drug disposition in elderly patients with diarrhea relative to young patients. No dosage adjustment is required for the elderly. In general, elderly patients may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects of the QT interval. Avoid loperamide hydrochloride in elderly patients taking drugs that can result in prolongation of the QT interval (for example, Class IA or III antiarrhythmics) or in patients with risk factors for Torsade de Pointes (see WARNINGS). Renal Impairment No pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with renal impairment. Since the metabolites and the unchanged drug are mainly excreted in the feces, no dosage adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment (see PRECAUTIONS). Hepatic Impairment Although no pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic impairment, loperamide hydrochloride should be used with caution in such patients because of reduced first pass metabolism (see PRECAUTIONS).
